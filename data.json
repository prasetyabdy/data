  "judul": "Evaluation of Fault Level of Sensitive Equipment Caused by Voltage Sag via Data Mining",
  "abstrak": "So far, there is no literature to evaluate the fault level of sensitive equipment (FLSE) caused by voltage sag from the perspective of the power grid. In practice, although the FLSE are dominated by the voltage sag of node, the voltage sag of the node is associated with whole power grid, including the voltage grade and location of the node, the distance between the concerned node and location of fault, and the weather and date at the time of fault, which are all named as voltage sag properties (VSP). In view of this gap, this paper evaluates the FLSE using the long-time monitoring data of VSP of some regional power grid by data mining method based on multidimensional matrix simplification and the improved gray target theory. The data mining process can be divided into three steps: 1) construct a database consisted of VSP and FLSE using long-time monitoring data, 2) mine the association rules between VSP and FLSE by multidimensional matrix simplification, and 3) match some actual scenario with the mined association rules by the improved gray target theory. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through the simulation and field case."

  "judul": "A Constrained Randomization Approach to Interactive Visual Data Exploration with Subjective Feedback",
  "abstrak": "Data visualization and iterative\/interactive data mining are growing rapidly in attention, both in research as well as in industry. However, while there are a plethora of advanced data mining methods and lots of works in the field of visualization, integrated methods that combine advanced visualization and\/or interaction with data mining techniques in a principled way are rare. We present a framework based on constrained randomization which lets users explore high-dimensional data via `subjectively informative' two-dimensional data visualizations. The user is presented with `interesting' projections, allowing users to express their observations using visual interactions that update a background model representing the user's belief state. This background model is then considered by a projection-finding algorithm employing data randomization to compute a new `interesting' projection. By providing users with information that contrasts with the background model, we maximize the chance that the user encounters striking new information present in the data. This process can be iterated until the user runs out of time or until the difference between the randomized and the real data is insignificant. We present two case studies, one controlled study on synthetic data and another on census data, using the proof-of-concept tool SIDE that demonstrates the presented framework."

  "judul": "Efficient Tree Structures for High Utility Pattern Mining in Incremental Databases",
  "abstrak": "Recently, high utility pattern (HUP) mining is one of the most important research issues in data mining due to its ability to consider the nonbinary frequency values of items in transactions and different profit values for every item. On the other hand, incremental and interactive data mining provide the ability to use previous data structures and mining results in order to reduce unnecessary calculations when a database is updated, or when the minimum threshold is changed. In this paper, we propose three novel tree structures to efficiently perform incremental and interactive HUP mining. The first tree structure, Incremental HUP Lexicographic Tree ({\\rm IHUP}_{{\\rm {L}}}-Tree), is arranged according to an item's lexicographic order. It can capture the incremental data without any restructuring operation. The second tree structure is the IHUP Transaction Frequency Tree ({\\rm IHUP}_{{\\rm {TF}}}-Tree), which obtains a compact size by arranging items according to their transaction frequency (descending order). To reduce the mining time, the third tree, IHUP-Transaction-Weighted Utilization Tree ({\\rm IHUP}_{{\\rm {TWU}}}-Tree) is designed based on the TWU value of items in descending order. Extensive performance analyses show that our tree structures are very efficient and scalable for incremental and interactive HUP mining."

  "judul": "Efficient Algorithms for Mining Top-K High Utility Itemsets",
  "abstrak": "High utility itemsets (HUIs) mining is an emerging topic in data mining, which refers to discovering all itemsets having a utility meeting a user-specified minimum utility threshold min_util. However, setting min_util appropriately is a difficult problem for users. Generally speaking, finding an appropriate minimum utility threshold by trial and error is a tedious process for users. If min_util is set too low, too many HUIs will be generated, which may cause the mining process to be very inefficient. On the other hand, if min_util is set too high, it is likely that no HUIs will be found. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a new framework for top-k high utility itemset mining, where k is the desired number of HUIs to be mined. Two types of efficient algorithms named TKU (mining Top-K Utility itemsets) and TKO (mining Top-K utility itemsets in One phase) are proposed for mining such itemsets without the need to set min_util. We provide a structural comparison of the two algorithms with discussions on their advantages and limitations. Empirical evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is close to that of the optimal case of state-of-the-art utility mining algorithms."

We proposed a platform to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of home monitoring using data mining for early detection of any worsening in patient's condition.

In this letter, we briefly describe the remote health monitoring platform we designed and realized, which supports heart failure (HF) severity assessment offering functions of data mining based on the classification and regression tree method. The system developed achieved accuracy and a precision of 96.39% and 100.00% in detecting HF and of 79.31% and 82.35% in distinguishing severe versus mild HF, respectively. These preliminary results were achieved on public databases of signals to improve their reproducibility. Clinical trials involving local patients are still running and will require longer experimentation."

  "judul": "Educational Data Mining to Support Programming Learning Using Problem-Solving Data",
  "abstrak": "Computer programming has attracted a lot of attention in the development of information and communication technologies in the real world. Meeting the growing demand for highly skilled programmers in the ICT industry is one of the major challenges. In this point, online judge (OJ) systems enhance programming learning and practice opportunities in addition to classroom-based learning. Consequently, OJ systems have created a large number of problem-solving data (solution codes, logs, and scores) archives that can be valuable raw materials for programming education research. In this paper, we propose an educational data mining framework to support programming learning using unsupervised algorithms. The framework includes the following sequence of steps: (\n i \n) problem-solving data collection (logs and scores are collected from the OJ) and preprocessing; (\n ii \n) MK-means clustering algorithm is used for data clustering in Euclidean space; (\n iii \n) statistical features are extracted from each cluster; (\n iv \n) frequent pattern (FP)-growth algorithm is applied to each cluster to mine data patterns and association rules; (\n v \n) a set of suggestions are provided on the basis of the extracted features, data patterns, and rules. Different parameters are adjusted to achieve the best results for clustering and association rule mining algorithms. For the experiment, approximately 70,000 real-world problem-solving data from 537 students of a programming course (Algorithm and Data Structures) were used. In addition, synthetic data have leveraged for experiments to demonstrate the performance of MK-means algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed framework effectively extracts useful features, patterns, and rules from problem-solving data. Moreover, these extracted features, patterns, and rules highlight the weaknesses and the scope of possible improvements in programming learning."

  "abstrak": "The relevance of business intelligence increases with the growing amount of recorded data. The research on business intelligence has led to a mature set of methods and tools that are used in many application areas, but they are almost absent in the auditing industry. Public accountants face the challenge to audit increasingly complex business processes that process huge amounts of transaction data. Process mining can be used as a business intelligence approach in the context of process audits to exploit this data. We introduce a process mining algorithm to improve such audits. Key requirements for this purpose are the reliability of the mining results, the integration of a data flow perspective and the ability to inspect data from the point of origin to the final output on the financial accounts. The presented algorithm integrates the control flow and data flow perspective. It operates on different abstraction levels to enable the auditor to follow the audit trail. The algorithm creates precise and fitting process models to prevent false negative and false positive audit results, accepts specific unlabeled event logs as input, and considers data relationships for inferring the control flow. It was evaluated by using extensive real world data."

In this paper the definition of query and non-query based systems is proposed, highlighting the needs of non-query based systems in the era of Big Data. For this, we propose a new approach of a non-query based system that combines association rules, generalized rules and sentiment analysis in order to catalogue and discover opinion patterns in the social network Twitter. Association rules have been previously applied for sentiment analysis, but in most cases, they are used once the process of sentiment analysis is finished to see which tokens appear commonly related to a certain sentiment. On the other hand, they have also been used to discover patterns between sentiments. Our work differs from these in that it proposes a non-query based system which combines both techniques, in a mixed proposal of sentiment analysis and association rules to discover patterns and sentiment patterns in microblogging texts. The obtained rules generalize and summarize the sentiments obtained from a group of tweets about any character, brand or product mentioned in them. To study the performance of the proposed system, an initial set of 1.7 million tweets have been employed to analyse the most salient sentiments during the American pre-election campaign. The analysis of the obtained results supports the capability of the system of obtaining association rules and patterns with great descriptive value in this use case. Parallelisms can be established in these patterns that match perfectly with real life events."

  "judul": "Enabling Multilevel Trust in Privacy Preserving Data Mining",
  "abstrak": "Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) addresses the problem of developing accurate models about aggregated data without access to precise information in individual data record. A widely studied perturbation-based PPDM approach introduces random perturbation to individual values to preserve privacy before data are published. Previous solutions of this approach are limited in their tacit assumption of single-level trust on data miners. In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of perturbation-based PPDM to Multilevel Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our setting, the more trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can access. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to differently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may combine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the original data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such diversity attacks is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services. We address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at different trust levels. We prove that our solution is robust against diversity attacks with respect to our privacy goal. That is, for data miners who have access to an arbitrary collection of the perturbed copies, our solution prevent them from jointly reconstructing the original data more accurately than the best effort using any individual copy in the collection. Our solution allows a data owner to generate perturbed copies of its data for arbitrary trust levels on-demand. This feature offers data owners maximum flexibility."

The reluctance of these companies to make data publicly available limits the wide use and development of data mining techniques and artificial intelligence research specific to the game industry. In this paper, we developed and implemented an international competition on game data mining using commercial game log data from one of the major game companies in South Korea: NCSOFT. Our approach enabled researchers to develop and apply state-of-the-art data mining techniques to game log data by making the data open. For the competition, data were collected from Blade & Soul, an action role-playing game, from NCSOFT. The data comprised approximately 100 GB of game logs from 10 000 players. The main aim of the competition was to predict whether a player would churn and when the player would churn during two periods between which the business model was changed to a free-to-play model from a monthly subscription. The results of the competition revealed that highly ranked competitors used deep learning, tree boosting, and linear regression."

  "abstrak": "The success of data mining learned rules highly depends on its actionability: how useful it is to perform suitable actions in any real business environment. To improve rule actionability, different researchers have initially presented various Data Mining (DM) frameworks by focusing on different factors only from the business domain \ndataset\n. Afterward, different Domain-Driven Data Mining (D3M) frameworks were introduced by focusing \non domain knowledge\n factors from the context of the overall business environment. Despite considering these several \ndataset\n factors and \ndomain knowledge\n factors in different phases of their frameworks, the learned rules still lacked actionability. The objective of our research is to improve the learned rules’ actionability. For this purpose, we have analyzed: (1) what overall actions or tasks are being performed in the overall business process, (2) in which sequence different tasks are being performed, (3) under what certain conditions these tasks are being performed, (4) by whom the tasks are being performed (5) what data is provided and produced in performing these tasks. We observed that the inclusion of rule learning factors only from \ndataset\n or from \ndomain knowledge\n is not sufficient. Our Process-based Domain-Driven Data Mining-Actionable Knowledge Discovery (PD3M-AKD) framework explains its different phases to consider and include additional factors from \nfive perspectives\n of the business process. This PD3M-AKD framework is also in line with the existing phases of current DM and D3M frameworks for considering and including \ndataset\n and \ndomain knowledge\n accordingly. Finally, we evaluated and validated our case study results from different real-life scenarios from education, engineering, and business process domains at the end."

In our method, we proposed, among all, case ID identification based on heuristics using context data and activity identification with supervised and unsupervised approaches, which provide complementary information about process execution. The method assumes an in-depth analysis of processes based on sensor data and knowledge gathered in IT systems, which can significantly improve the quality of information at managers’ disposal when making decisions regarding the mining process."

With the advances in database technology and an exponential increase in data to be stored, there is a need for efficient approaches that can quickly extract useful information from such large datasets. Frequent Itemsets (FIs) mining is a data mining task to find itemsets in a transactional database which occur together above a certain frequency. Finding these FIs usually requires multiple passes over the databases; therefore, making efficient algorithms crucial for mining FIs. This work presents a graph-based approach for representing a complete transactional database. The proposed graph-based representation enables the storing of all relevant information (for extracting FIs) of the database in one pass. Later, an algorithm that extracts the FIs from the graph-based structure is presented. Experimental results are reported comparing the proposed approach with 17 related FIs mining methods using six benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed approach performs better than others in terms of time."

  "abstrak": "CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics."

  "abstrak": "The growing popularity and development of data mining technologies bring serious threat to the security of individual,'s sensitive information. An emerging research topic in data mining, known as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), has been extensively studied in recent years. The basic idea of PPDM is to modify the data in such a way so as to perform data mining algorithms effectively without compromising the security of sensitive information contained in the data. Current studies of PPDM mainly focus on how to reduce the privacy risk brought by data mining operations, while in fact, unwanted disclosure of sensitive information may also happen in the process of data collecting, data publishing, and information (i.e., the data mining results) delivering. In this paper, we view the privacy issues related to data mining from a wider perspective and investigate various approaches that can help to protect sensitive information. In particular, we identify four different types of users involved in data mining applications, namely, data provider, data collector, data miner, and decision maker. For each type of user, we discuss his privacy concerns and the methods that can be adopted to protect sensitive information. We briefly introduce the basics of related research topics, review state-of-the-art approaches, and present some preliminary thoughts on future research directions. Besides exploring the privacy-preserving approaches for each type of user, we also review the game theoretical approaches, which are proposed for analyzing the interactions among different users in a data mining scenario, each of whom has his own valuation on the sensitive information. By differentiating the responsibilities of different users with respect to security of sensitive information, we would like to provide some useful insights into the study of PPDM."

  "judul": "Combined Mining: Discovering Informative Knowledge in Complex Data",
  "abstrak": "Enterprise data mining applications often involve complex data such as multiple large heterogeneous data sources, user preferences, and business impact. In such situations, a single method or one-step mining is often limited in discovering informative knowledge. It would also be very time and space consuming, if not impossible, to join relevant large data sources for mining patterns consisting of multiple aspects of information. It is crucial to develop effective approaches for mining patterns combining necessary information from multiple relevant business lines, catering for real business settings and decision-making actions rather than just providing a single line of patterns. The recent years have seen increasing efforts on mining more informative patterns, e.g., integrating frequent pattern mining with classifications to generate frequent pattern-based classifiers. Rather than presenting a specific algorithm, this paper builds on our existing works and proposes combined mining as a general approach to mining for informative patterns combining components from either multiple data sets or multiple features or by multiple methods on demand. We summarize general frameworks, paradigms, and basic processes for multifeature combined mining, multisource combined mining, and multimethod combined mining. Novel types of combined patterns, such as incremental cluster patterns, can result from such frameworks, which cannot be directly produced by the existing methods. A set of real-world case studies has been conducted to test the frameworks, with some of them briefed in this paper. They identify combined patterns for informing government debt prevention and improving government service objectives, which show the flexibility and instantiation capability of combined mining in discovering informative knowledge in complex data."

We significantly extend prior art by representing the sentinel mining problem by bitmap operations, using bitmapped encoding of so-called indication streams. We present a very efficient algorithm, SentBit, that is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, and utilizes CPU specific instructions and the multicore architectures available on modern processors. The SentBit algorithm scales efficiently to very large data sets, which is verified by extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data."

  "abstrak": "Mining high utility itemsets (HUI) is an interesting research problem in the field of data mining and knowledge discovery. Recently, bio-inspired computing has attracted considerable attention, leading to the development of new algorithms for mining HUIs. These algorithms have shown good performance in terms of efficiency, but are not guaranteed to find all HUIs in a database. That is, the quality is comparatively poor in terms of the number of discovered HUIs. To solve this problem, a new framework based on bio-inspired algorithms is proposed. This approach adjusts the standard roadmap of bio-inspired algorithms by proportionally selecting discovered HUIs as the target values of the next population, rather than maintaining the current optimal values in the next population. Thus, the diversity within populations can be improved. Three new algorithms based on the Bio-HUI framework are developed using the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and the bat algorithm, respectively. Extensive tests conducted on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency, quality of results, and convergence speed."

  "abstrak": "Pattern mining is one of the most important tasks to extract meaningful and useful information from raw data. This task aims to extract item-sets that represent any type of homogeneity and regularity in data. Although many efficient algorithms have been developed in this regard, the growing interest in data has caused the performance of existing pattern mining techniques to be dropped. The goal of this paper is to propose new efficient pattern mining algorithms to work in big data. To this aim, a series of algorithms based on the MapReduce framework and the Hadoop open-source implementation have been proposed. The proposed algorithms can be divided into three main groups. First, two algorithms [Apriori MapReduce (AprioriMR) and iterative AprioriMR] with no pruning strategy are proposed, which extract any existing itemset in data. Second, two algorithms (space pruning AprioriMR and top AprioriMR) that prune the search space by means of the well-known anti-monotone property are proposed. Finally, a last algorithm (maximal AprioriMR) is also proposed for mining condensed representations of frequent patterns. To test the performance of the proposed algorithms, a varied collection of big data datasets have been considered, comprising up to 3·1018 transactions and more than 5 million of distinct single-items. The experimental stage includes comparisons against highly efficient and well-known pattern mining algorithms. Results reveal the interest of applying MapReduce versions when complex problems are considered, and also the unsuitability of this paradigm when dealing with small data."

  "judul": "A Distributed Method for Fast Mining Frequent Patterns From Big Data",
  "abstrak": "In recent years, knowledge discovery in databases provides a powerful capability to discover meaningful and useful information. For numerous real-life applications, frequent pattern mining and association rule mining have been extensively studied. In traditional mining algorithms, data are centralized and memory-resident. As a result of the large amount of data, bandwidth limitation, and energy limitations when applying these methods to distributed databases, especially in this era of big data, the performance is not effective enough. Hence, data mining on distributed environments has emerged as an important research area. To improve the performance, we propose a set of algorithms based on FP growth that discover FPs that are capable of providing fast and scalable service in distributed computing environments and a brief data structure to store items and counts to minimize the data for transmission on the network. To ensure completeness and execution capability, DistEclat and BigFIM were considered for the experiment comparison. Experiments show that the proposed method has superior cost-effectiveness for processing massive datasets and good capabilities under various experiment conditions. The proposed method on average required only 33% of the execution time and 45% of the transmission cost of DistEclat. Compared to BigFIM, The proposed method on average required 23.3% of the execution time and 14.2% of the transmission cost of BigFIM."

  "abstrak": "With the fast development of various positioning techniques such as Global Position System (GPS), mobile devices and remote sensing, spatio-temporal data has become increasingly available nowadays. Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real-world applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal data increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics-based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently deep learning models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved remarkable success in many domains due to the powerful ability in automatic feature representation learning, and are also widely applied in various spatio-temporal data mining (STDM) tasks such as predictive learning, anomaly detection and classification. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in applying deep learning techniques for STDM. We first categorize the spatio-temporal data into five different types, and then briefly introduce the deep learning models that are widely used in STDM. Next, we classify existing literature based on the types of spatio-temporal data, the data mining tasks, and the deep learning models, followed by the applications of deep learning for STDM in different domains including transportation, on-demand service, climate & weather analysis, human mobility, location-based social network, crime analysis, and neuroscience. Finally, we conclude the limitations of current research and point out future research directions."

In this paper, we propose the Random Sample Partition (RSP) distributed data model to represent a big data set as a set of disjoint data blocks, called RSP blocks. Each RSP block has a probability distribution similar to that of the entire data set. RSP blocks can be used to estimate the statistical properties of the data and build predictive models without computing the entire data set. We demonstrate the implications of the RSP model on sampling from big data and introduce a new RSP-based method for approximate big data analysis which can be applied to different scenarios in the industry. This method significantly reduces the computational burden of big data and increases the productivity of data scientists."

Therefore, this paper proposes a knowledge mining network for regional flow pattern to mine and store the urban flow pattern. The proposed model consists of two modules. In the first module, the features of the region and its flow pattern are extracted as the entity and relation, respectively. In the second module, POI features are modeled to enhance the embedding representation of relation and entity. Based on the translation distance method, the knowledge triplets of regional flow patterns are mined. Finally, the proposed model is compared with some benchmark methods using Chengdu Didi order and POI datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective.

The approach is fully data-driven, where the temporal rules are mined from physiological time series such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure. To validate the rules, a novel similarity method is introduced, that compares the similarity between rule sets. An additional aspect of the proposed approach has been to utilize natural language generation techniques to represent the temporal relations between patterns. In this study, the sensor data in the MIMIC online database was used for evaluation, in which the mined temporal rules as they relate to various clinical conditions (respiratory failure, angina, sepsis, ...) were made explicit as a textual representation. Furthermore, it was shown that the extracted rule set for any particular clinical condition was distinct from other clinical conditions."

  "judul": "Knowledge Fusion for Probabilistic Generative Classifiers with Data Mining Applications",
  "abstrak": "If knowledge such as classification rules are extracted from sample data in a distributed way, it may be necessary to combine or fuse these rules. In a conventional approach this would typically be done either by combining the classifiers' outputs (e.g., in form of a classifier ensemble) or by combining the sets of classification rules (e.g., by weighting them individually). In this paper, we introduce a new way of fusing classifiers at the level of parameters of classification rules. This technique is based on the use of probabilistic generative classifiers using multinomial distributions for categorical input dimensions and multivariate normal distributions for the continuous ones. That means, we have distributions such as Dirichlet or normal-Wishart distributions over parameters of the classifier. We refer to these distributions as hyperdistributions or second-order distributions. We show that fusing two (or more) classifiers can be done by multiplying the hyperdistributions of the parameters and derive simple formulas for that task. Properties of this new approach are demonstrated with a few experiments. The main advantage of this fusion approach is that the hyperdistributions are retained throughout the fusion process. Thus, the fused components may, for example, be used in subsequent training steps (online training)."

  "abstrak": "The traditional data mining method is featured by no analysis over the data distribution and incomplete derived association rule. As a result, the data mining results have the deficiencies of large redundancy probability, large root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) and long consumption time. To handle these issues, this paper proposes a medical data stream distribution pattern association rule mining algorithm based on density estimation. This paper collects medical data, selects the distance method to detect abnormal orphan data in the data stream, detects the duplicate data in the data stream by the similar field matching degree, and eliminates the abnormal data and the duplicate data. Then, the data stream density is estimated based on the histogram estimation samples. According to the data density estimation results, this paper analyzes the distribution of medical data stream from perspectives of concentration, dispersion and morphological characteristics of data distribution. Afterwards, the data distribution pattern association rule mining model is constructed based on compound neural network, data distribution parameters are entered into model’s clustering layer, and in-depth training is conducted over the BP (Back Propagation) neural network at the model’s mining layer. Meanwhile, all rules under the combination of hidden layer’s neuron activity value and corresponding output value, and all rules under the combination of hidden layer’s neuron activity value and corresponding input value are derived, so as to complete association rule mining of medical data stream distribution pattern. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a contour curve closest to the true probability density curve; the dispersion degree of medical data is within a reasonable range, and the medical data has high stability; the data redundancy probability is smaller; the mining result’s RMSEA is small; data mining takes less time."

  "abstrak": "Utility mining is a new development of data mining technology. Among utility mining problems, utility mining with the itemset share framework is a hard one as no anti-monotonicity property holds with the interestingness measure. Prior works on this problem all employ a two-phase, candidate generation approach with one exception that is however inefficient and not scalable with large databases. The two-phase approach suffers from scalability issue due to the huge number of candidates. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that finds high utility patterns in a single phase without generating candidates. The novelties lie in a high utility pattern growth approach, a lookahead strategy, and a linear data structure. Concretely, our pattern growth approach is to search a reverse set enumeration tree and to prune search space by utility upper bounding. We also look ahead to identify high utility patterns without enumeration by a closure property and a singleton property. Our linear data structure enables us to compute a tight bound for powerful pruning and to directly identify high utility patterns in an efficient and scalable way, which targets the root cause with prior algorithms. Extensive experiments on sparse and dense, synthetic and real world data suggest that our algorithm is up to 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient and is more scalable than the state-of-the-art algorithms."

We introduce the task of finding small and non-redundant sets of associations that describe how the two views are related. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach in which sets of rules are used to translate one view to the other and vice versa. Our models, dubbed translation tables, contain both unidirectional and bidirectional rules that span both views and provide lossless translation from either of the views to the opposite view. To be able to evaluate different translation tables and perform model selection, we present a score based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Next, we introduce three TRANSLATOR algorithms to find good models according to this score. The first algorithm is parameter-free and iteratively adds the rule that improves compression most. The other two algorithms use heuristics to achieve better trade-offs between runtime and compression. The empirical evaluation on real-world data demonstrates that only modest numbers of associations are needed to characterize the two-view structure present in the data, while the obtained translation rules are easily interpretable and provide insight into the data."

However, there is a lack of research on extracting spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of large-scale and high-resolution surface deformation in backfill mining areas and on evaluating the filling effectiveness of subsidence restraint. In this study, we took the Yineng Coal Mine in the Shandong Province of China and the surrounding area of the coal mine as the study area. The advanced distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS InSAR) technique was adopted for time-series analysis. The probability integral method (PIM) model for backfilling mining and an arctangent time function were integrated with DS InSAR to overcome the sparsity of InSAR observation points due to the temporal decorrelation caused by vegetation coverage. The results show that the proposed integration strategy is helpful in improving the number of effective monitoring points and obtaining complete spatiotemporal information of the surface deformation of the working face. The whole study area has eight key deformation zones. All six working faces in the Yineng initial minery display different degrees of deformation during the study period. The comparison between the deformation results of backfill mining and the simulated deformation of nonbackfill mining in the CG1312 working face shows that backfilling mining technology effectively reduces the range (22.00%) and magnitude (61.50%) of surface subsidence and significantly reduces the potential threat to surface buildings."

  "abstrak": "Mining interesting knowledge from the huge amount of data gathered from WSNs is a challenge. Works reported in literature use support metric-based sensor association rules which employ the occurrence frequency of patterns as criteria. However, consideration of the binary frequency of a pattern is not a sufficient indicator for finding meaningful patterns because it only reflects the number of epochs which contain that pattern in the dataset. The share measure of sensorsets could discover useful knowledge about trigger values associated with a sensor. Here, we propose a new type of behavioral pattern called share-frequent sensor patterns (SFSPs) by considering the non-binary frequency values of sensors in epochs. SFSPs can find a correlation among a set of sensors and hence can improve the performance of WSNs in a resource management process. In this paper, a share-frequent sensor pattern tree (ShrFSP-tree) has been proposed to facilitate a pattern growth mining technique to discover SFSPs from WSN data. We also present a parallel and distributed method where the ShrFSP-tree is enhanced into PShrFSP-tree and its performance is investigated for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Results show that our method is time and memory efficient in finding SFSPs than the existing most efficient algorithms."

It has been extensively applied in tasks with privacy requirements, such as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), to learn task output and at the same time protect input data privacy. However, existing SMC-based solutions are ad-hoc - they are proposed for specific applications, and thus cannot be applied to other applications directly. To address this issue, we propose a privacy model DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that consists of a set of fundamental secure operators (e.g., +, -, ×, \/, and power). Our model is general - its operators, if pipelined together, can implement various functions, even complicated ones like Naı̈ve Bayes classifier. It is also extendable - new secure operators can be defined to expand the functions that the model supports. For case study, we have applied our DAG model to two data mining tasks: kernel regression and Naı̈ve Bayes. Experimental results show that DAG generates outputs that are almost the same as those by non-private setting, where multiple parties simply disclose their data. The experimental results also show that our DAG model runs in acceptable time, e.g., in kernel regression, when training data size is 683,093, one prediction in non-private setting takes 5.93 sec, and that by our DAG model takes 12.38 sec."

Recently, applications using time interval-based event data have attracted considerable efforts in discovering patterns from events that persist for some duration. Since the relationship between two intervals is intrinsically complex, how to effectively and efficiently mine interval-based sequences is a challenging issue. In this paper, two novel representations, endpoint representation and endtime representation, are proposed to simplify the processing of complex relationships among event intervals. Based on the proposed representations, three types of interval-based patterns: temporal pattern, occurrence-probabilistic temporal pattern, and duration-probabilistic temporal pattern, are defined. In addition, we develop two novel algorithms, Temporal Pattern Miner (TPMiner) and Probabilistic Temporal Pattern Miner (P-TPMiner), to discover three types of interval-based sequential patterns. We also propose three pruning techniques to further reduce the search space of the mining process. Experimental studies show that both algorithms are able to find three types of patterns efficiently. Furthermore, we apply proposed algorithms to real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and validate the practicability of proposed patterns."

We consider the server that is potentially untrusted and tries to escape from verification by using its prior knowledge of the outsourced data. We propose efficient probabilistic and deterministic verification approaches to check whether the server has returned correct and complete frequent itemsets. Our probabilistic approach can catch incorrect results with high probability, while our deterministic approach measures the result correctness with 100 percent certainty.

It is generally known that data which are sourced from data streams accumulate continuously making traditional batch-based model induction algorithms infeasible for real-time data mining. Feature selection has been popularly used to lighten the processing load in inducing a data mining model. However, when it comes to mining over high dimensional data the search space from which an optimal feature subset is derived grows exponentially in size, leading to an intractable demand in computation. In order to tackle this problem which is mainly based on the high-dimensionality and streaming format of data feeds in Big Data, a novel lightweight feature selection is proposed. The feature selection is designed particularly for mining streaming data on the fly, by using accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) type of swarm search that achieves enhanced analytical accuracy within reasonable processing time.

There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latter consists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mining have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting\/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory (sensitive) attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, anti-discrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on nonsensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive ones. In this paper, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data sets in such a way that direct and\/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (nondiscriminatory) classification rules. We also propose new metrics to evaluate the utility of the proposed approaches and we compare these approaches. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and\/or indirect discrimination biases in the original data set while preserving data quality."

By evaluation of a numerical experiment and theoretical comparisons, the correctness, security, and efficiency of SecEDMO are confirmed."

  "abstrak": "Data-driven knowledge acquisition is one of the key research fields in data mining. Dealing with large amounts of data has received a lot of attention in the field recently, and a number of methodologies have been proposed to extract insights from data in an automated or semi-automated manner. However, these methodologies generally target a specific aspect of the data mining process, such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, or data classification. However, a comprehensive knowledge acquisition method is crucial to support the end-to-end knowledge engineering process. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge acquisition system that covers all major phases of the cross-industry standard process for data mining. Acknowledging the importance of an end-to-end knowledge engineering process, we designed and developed an easy-to-use data-driven knowledge acquisition tool (DDKAT). The major features of the DDKAT are: (1) a novel unified features scoring approach for data selection; (2) a user-friendly data processing interface to improve the quality of the raw data; (3) an appropriate decision tree algorithm selection approach to build a classification model; and (4) the generation of production rules from various decision tree classification models in an automated manner. Furthermore, two diabetes studies were performed to assess the value of the DDKAT in terms of user experience. A total of 19 experts were involved in the first study and 102 students in the artificial intelligence domain were involved in the second study. The results showed that the overall user experience of the DDKAT was positive in terms of its attractiveness, as well as its pragmatic and hedonic quality factors."

  "judul": "Efficient Frequent Chronicle Mining Algorithms: Application to Sleep Disorder",
  "abstrak": "Sequential pattern mining is a dynamic and thriving research field that aims to extract recurring sequences of events from complex datasets. Traditionally, focusing solely on the order of events often falls short of providing precise insights. Consequently, incorporating the temporal intervals between events has emerged as a vital necessity across various domains, e.g. medicine. Analyzing temporal event sequences within patients’ clinical histories, drug prescriptions, and monitoring alarms exemplifies this critical need. This paper presents innovative and efficient methodologies for mining frequent chronicles from temporal data. The mined graphs offer a significantly more expressive representation than mere event sequences, capturing intricate details of a series of events in a factual manner. The experimental stage includes a series of analyses of diverse databases with distinct characteristics. The proposed approaches were also applied to real-world data comprising information about subjects suffering from sleep disorders. Alluring frequent complete event graphs were obtained on patients who were under the effect of sleep medication."

  "abstrak": "Incremental mining improves the quality of process mining by analyzing the differences between event logs and a reference model to obtain valuable information to update the reference model. Existing incremental mining methods focus on offline logs by setting thresholds for analysis, which limits process mining efforts by the domain knowledge, log completeness, and business completion time. Aiming at these problems, a real-time incremental mining algorithm based on the trusted behavior interval is proposed to analyze online event streams for updating the reference model. First, a clustering technique to analyze an existing reference model selects the core structure of the model and calculates the trusted behavior interval. Then, the behavioral and structural relationships between the online event streams and the reference model are analyzed to obtain a valid candidate set. Based on this set, an incremental update algorithm is proposed to optimize the model structure to achieve an online dynamic update of the reference model. The proposed algorithm is implemented in PM4PY and Scikit-learn frameworks; a reasonable number of clusters is determined using the elbow method and validated with artificial and real data. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves the efficiency of incremental mining and enhances the quality of the model with both complete and incomplete data."

In order to enhance the performance of fuzzy c-means parallel expansion, the improvement strategy of k-means during the initialization phase is borrowed, and k-means\/\/ is extended to fuzzy c-means to obtain better clustering performance. Combined with Spark's programming model, this paper can obtain extended parallel fuzzy c-means algorithm. Several experiments on the data set of the algorithm proposed in this paper have shown good scalability and parallelism, effectively expanding fuzzy c-means clustering to distributed applications, greatly increasing the scale of the data processed by the algorithm. This improves the robustness of the algorithm and the adaptability of the algorithm to the shape and structure of the data, so that the parallel and scalable clustering algorithm can more effectively perform cluster analysis on big data. Three algorithms were simulated on MATLAB platform. We use simple data sets and complex two-dimensional data sets, and compare with the traditional fuzzy c-means algorithm and fuzzy c-means algorithm based on fuzzy entropy. Experiments show that the scalable parallel fuzzy c-means algorithm not only greatly improves the anti-noise performance, but also improves the convergence speed, and it can automatically determine the optimal number of clusters."

The basic ideas and methods are proposed; that is, the two-stage surface digital elevation model (DEM) is obtained in the short term by UAV; The SDSB is obtained through two phases of DEM subtraction; Based on the dynamic inversion method established in this study, the PMS was obtained. The UAV method was used to monitor the Wangjiata coal mine in Inner Mongolia of China three times in three months to obtain the three phases of DEM; we obtained the two phases SDSB by the three phases of DEM subtraction. The accuracy of DEM and SDSB were 118 mm and 121 mm respectively, Although the accuracy cannot fulfill the requirements of mining subsidence, the PMS was obtained by dynamic inversion method of full subsidence basin fitting, which has better resistance to errors; hence, the obtained PMS are reliable. Based on the engineering application, this study concludes that as a new technology, UAV photogrammetry technology can obtain the SDSB of coal mining areas in a short period with reliable PMS. Meanwhile, it has the advantages of low cost, flexible maneuverability, and so on, and overcomes the shortages of traditional observation stations, which has long observation time and high labor intensity, needs to bury fixed measuring points and easily lose them, and just has a small amount of “spot-like” observation data that cannot reflect the deformation characteristics of the whole subsidence basin. Furthermore, it is feasible to apply this method to mining subsidence monitoring and parameter inversion, and it has a great application prospect for the mining area purposes."

Various data mining techniques have been applied for rehabilitation to predict and recommend suitable recovery paths and training. In addition, the gamification concept was applied to rehabilitation training to motivate the patients to follow the training until the end. Considerable research has been conducted to investigate the validity and effectiveness of these techniques using massive patient data on specific conditions and treatment contexts. However, it is still unclear how to effectively offer customized rehabilitation training for stroke patients using gamification and data mining approaches. Thus, to understand how researchers studied them, we examined 34 peer-reviewed articles published in computer science and medical proceedings and journals between 2012 and 2022. We systematically reviewed the data mining and gamification techniques researchers had applied for post-stroke rehabilitation and related prediction models resulting from the data mining processes. As a result of the analyses, three significant contributions are identified. This article 1) identifies trends in data mining and gamification used in personalized post-stroke rehabilitation training; 2) maps trends in the study of data mining and gamification in post-stroke rehabilitation; and 3) identifies underexplored studies for future work. There is a definite need to continue developing and researching intervention strategies related to rehabilitation to address recovery problems by providing accuracy and protection of healthcare, as well as incorporating components that promote patients’ motivation and engagement."

To unleash the value of event data, events need to be tightly connected to the control and management of operational processes.

Big data initiatives rarely focus on the improvement of end-to-end processes. To address this mismatch, we advocate a better integration of data science, data technology and process science. Data science approaches tend to be process agonistic whereas process science approaches tend to be model-driven without considering the “evidence” hidden in the data. Process mining aims to bridge this gap.

  "abstrak": "Due to the complexity of the underlying biological processes, gene expression data obtained from DNA microarray technologies are typically noisy and have very high dimensionality and these make the mining of such data for gene function prediction very difficult. To tackle these difficulties, we propose to use an incremental fuzzy mining technique called incremental fuzzy mining (IFM). By transforming quantitative expression values into linguistic terms, such as highly or lowly expressed, IFM can effectively capture heterogeneity in expression data for pattern discovery. It does so using a fuzzy measure to determine if interesting association patterns exist between the linguistic gene expression levels. Based on these patterns, IFM can make accurate gene function predictions and these predictions can be made in such a way that each gene can be allowed to belong to more than one functional class with different degrees of membership. Gene function prediction problem can be formulated both as classification and clustering problems, and IFM can be used either as a classification technique or together with existing clustering algorithms to improve the cluster groupings discovered for greater prediction accuracies. IFM is characterized also by its being an incremental data mining technique so that the discovered patterns can be continually refined based only on newly collected data without the need for retraining using the whole dataset. For performance evaluation, IFM has been tested with real expression datasets for both classification and clustering tasks. Experimental results show that it can effectively uncover hidden patterns for accurate gene function predictions."

  "abstrak": "Subsidence of the gob area is an important geological problem in coal mines. Such events not only pose potential safety risks, but also can seriously impair the subsequent mining of coal mines. Therefore, detection of gob subsidence is important to ensure sustainable coal mining. Due to the complex seismic and geological conditions in the gob subsidence area, it is difficult to accurately identify the gob area by using traditional three-dimensional (3-D) seismic detection method. Herein, a new, model-driven gob detection method based on four-dimensional (4-D) seismic data is proposed. According to the proposed strategy, geological models before and after coal seam mining are firstly established, and synthetic data are generated through forward modeling. Then, the prestack time migration (PSTM) sections of synthetic data are used to retrospectively analyze the seismic reflection characteristics of the gob area, and the gob area is identified according to the variations of reflection characteristics and velocity fields caused by the gobs. Next, the characteristics of gob areas in synthetic data are used to guide the identification of the gob area in real seismic data. Meanwhile, a 3-D stratum stripping technique is used to finely depict the gob area. According to the method, the scope of the caving zone, the height of the overburden fractured zone in the gob area, and the geological structure of the lower coal seam in the gob area can be ascertained. This article presents the successful use of the proposed method in detecting the gob area from a real coal mine."

  "abstrak": "Protecting the privacy of healthcare information is an important part of encouraging data custodians to give accurate records so that mining may proceed with confidence. The application of association rule mining in healthcare data has been widespread to this point in time. Most applications focus on positive association rules, ignoring the negative consequences of particular diagnostic techniques. When it comes to bridging divergent diseases and drugs, negative association rules may give more helpful information than positive ones. This is especially true when it comes to physicians and social organizations (e.g., a certain symptom will not arise when certain symptoms exist). Data mining in healthcare must be done in a way that protects the identity of patients, especially when dealing with sensitive information. However, revealing this information puts it at risk of attack. Healthcare data privacy protection has lately been addressed by technologies that disrupt data (data sanitization) and reconstruct aggregate distributions in the interest of doing research in data mining. In this study, metaheuristic-based data sanitization for healthcare data mining is investigated in order to keep patient privacy protected. It is hoped that by using the Tabu-genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, the suggested technique chooses item sets to be sanitized (modified) from transactions that satisfy sensitive negative criteria with the goal of minimizing changes to the original database. Experiments with benchmark healthcare datasets show that the suggested privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of Hiding Failure (HF), Artificial Rule Generation (AR), and Lost Rules (LR)."

Mining sequential patterns from inaccurate data, such as those data arising from sensor readings and GPS trajectories, is important for discovering hidden knowledge in such applications. In this paper, we propose to measure pattern frequentness based on the possible world semantics. We establish two uncertain sequence data models abstracted from many real-life applications involving uncertain sequence data, and formulate the problem of mining probabilistically frequent sequential patterns (or p-FSPs) from data that conform to our models. However, the number of possible worlds is extremely large, which makes the mining prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the famous PrefixSpan algorithm, we develop two new algorithms, collectively called U-PrefixSpan, for p-FSP mining. U-PrefixSpan effectively avoids the problem of “possible worlds explosion”, and when combined with our four pruning and validating methods, achieves even better performance. We also propose a fast validating method to further speed up our U-PrefixSpan algorithm. The efficiency and effectiveness of U-PrefixSpan are verified through extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets."

Excellent drivers are employed to drive vehicles with manual transmission to obtain a large amount of driving data. Subsequently, data preprocessing, data cleaning, and outlier removal are performed on the collected driving data to extract the shift boundary points of each gear aiming at constructing the shift rule surface of each gear. Using the uphill condition as an example, a data-mining-based shift control strategy is established, and the comparison results verify that the proposed gear decision design method can mine the shift strategy of excellent drivers from massive driving data, and the constructed strategy can better adapt to the driver’s intention while obtaining better fuel economy and avoiding unreasonable gearshifts compared with the automatic transmission’s default strategy."

For the purpose of event detection in cyber-physical systems (CPS), e.g., damage in building or aerospace vehicles from the continuous arriving data is challenging due to the detection quality. Traditional data mining schemes are used to reduce data that often use metrics, association rules, and binary values for frequent patterns as indicators for finding interesting knowledge about an event. However, these may not be directly applicable to the network due to certain constraints (communication, computation, bandwidth). We discover that, the indicators may not reveal meaningful information for event detection in practice. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive data mining framework for event detection in the CPS named DPminer, which functions in a distributed and parallel manner (data in a partitioned database processed by one or more sensor processors) and is able to extract a pattern of sensors that may have event information with a low communication cost. To achieve this, we introduce a new sensor behavioral pattern mining technique called differential sensor pattern (DSP) which considers different frequencies and values (non-binary) with a set of sensors, instead of traditional binary patterns. We present an algorithm for data preparation and then use a highly-compact data tree structure (called DP-Tree) for generating the DSP. An important tradeoff between the communication and computation costs for the event detection via data mining is made. Evaluation results show that DPminer can be very useful for networked sensing with a superior performance in terms of communication cost and event detection quality compared to existing data mining schemes."

Firstly, this paper proposes that the clustering-number determination is optimized by using a statistic which has never been used in the algorithm of K-means. Then, the clustering effect of K-means algorithm is tested by discriminant analysis. The convolutional neural network is introduced for training and testing data that are labeled with categories.

Since patterns can hold in either all or some of the intervals, we propose a new algorithm to restrict time intervals, which is called frequent itemset mining with time cubes. Our focus is developing an efficient algorithm for this mining problem by extending the well-known a priori algorithm. The notion of time cubes is proposed to handle time hierarchies. This is the way by which the patterns that happen periodically, during a time interval or both, are recognized. A new density threshold is also proposed to solve the overestimating problem of time periods and also make sure that discovered patterns are valid. We evaluate our algorithms via experiments."

Dependency of transactions on time and location further makes frequent itemset mining task more complex. The present work targets to identify and extract the frequent patterns from such time and location-aware transactional data. Primarily, the spatio-temporal dependency of air quality data is leveraged to find out frequently co-occurring pollutants over several locations of Delhi, the capital city of India. Varied approaches have been proposed in the past to extract frequent patterns efficiently, but this work suggests a generalized approach that can be applied to any numeric spatio-temporal transactional data, including air quality data. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of the algorithm along with a sample running example on air quality dataset is shown in this work. A detailed experimental evaluation is carried out on the synthetically generated datasets, benchmark datasets, and real world datasets. Furthermore, a comparison with spatio-temporal apriori as well as the other state-of-the-art non-apriori-based algorithms is shown.

We then propose a cloud-aided frequent itemset mining solution, which is used to build an association rule mining solution. Our solutions are designed for outsourced databases that allow multiple data owners to efficiently share their data securely without compromising on data privacy. Our solutions leak less information about the raw data than most existing solutions. In comparison to the only known solution achieving a similar privacy level as our proposed solutions, the performance of our proposed solutions is three to five orders of magnitude higher. Based on our experiment findings using different parameters and data sets, we demonstrate that the run time in each of our solutions is only one order higher than that in the best non-privacy-preserving data mining algorithms. Since both data and computing work are outsourced to the cloud servers, the resource consumption at the data owner end is very low."

  "abstrak": "Chronic diseases have been among the major concerns in medical fields since they may cause a heavy burden on healthcare resources and disturb the quality of life. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for early assessment on chronic diseases by mining sequential risk patterns with time interval information from diagnostic clinical records using sequential rules mining, and classification modeling techniques. With a complete workflow, the proposed framework consists of four phases namely data preprocessing, risk pattern mining, classification modeling, and post analysis. For empiricasl evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework with a case study on early assessment of COPD. Through experimental evaluation on a large-scale nationwide clinical database in Taiwan, our approach can not only derive rich sequential risk patterns but also extract novel patterns with valuable insights for further medical investigation such as discovering novel markers and better treatments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the issue of mining sequential risk patterns with time-intervals as well as classification models for early assessment of chronic diseases."

However, large recommendation systems with trust data suffer from the sparse trust problem, which leads to grade inflation and severely affects the reliability of trust propagation. This paper presents a novel research on sparse trust data mining, which includes the new concept of sparse trust, a sparse trust model, and a trust mining framework. It lays a foundation for the trust-related research in large recommended systems. The new trust mining framework is based on customized normalization functions and a novel transitive gossip trust model, which discovers potential trust information between entities in a large-scale user network and applies it to a recommendation system. We conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results confirm that our framework mines new trust and effectively ameliorates sparse trust problem."

Then, this article outlines the high utility derivative patterns, including high average utility pattern, high utility sequential pattern, and high utility compact pattern and so on.

  "abstrak": "Sequential pattern mining is a dynamic and thriving research field that aims to extract recurring sequences of events from complex datasets. Traditionally, focusing solely on the order of events often falls short of providing precise insights. Consequently, incorporating the temporal intervals between events has emerged as a vital necessity across various domains, e.g. medicine. Analyzing temporal event sequences within patients’ clinical histories, drug prescriptions, and monitoring alarms exemplifies this critical need. This paper presents innovative and efficient methodologies for mining frequent chronicles from temporal data. The mined graphs offer a significantly more expressive representation than mere event sequences, capturing intricate details of a series of events in a factual manner. The experimental stage includes a series of analyses of diverse databases with distinct characteristics. The proposed approaches were also applied to real-world data comprising information about subjects suffering from sleep disorders. Alluring frequent complete event graphs were obtained on patients who were under the effect of sleep medication."

  "abstrak": "High utility pattern mining has been proposed to improve the traditional support-based pattern mining methods that process binary databases. High utility patterns are discovered by effectively considering the quantity and importance of items. Recently, high utility occupancy pattern mining studies have been conducted to extract high-quality patterns by utilizing both the occupancy utility and frequency measure. Although the previous approaches provide worthy information in terms of utility occupancy, they require time-consuming tasks because of numerous comparison operations in exploring entries in global data structures. This results in significant performance degradation when the database is large, or a pre-defined threshold is low. An indexed list structure improves the inefficiency of the list-based approach by structurally connecting each tuple. In this paper, we propose an efficient high utility occupancy mining approach based on novel indexed list-based structures. The two newly designed data structures maintain index information on items or patterns and facilitate rapid pattern extension. Our approach improves the cost of generating long patterns of list-based ones by reducing a large number of comparison overheads. In addition, we devise novel constructing and mining methods that are suitable for the proposed data structures and utility occupancy functions. To narrow the wide search space, efficient pruning techniques apply to the designed methods. Thorough performance experiments using real and synthetic datasets show that our method is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods in environments where given thresholds change."

With sufficient road information, the map of road topography can be built and updated more easily. Furthermore, many appealing ITS applications can be enabled accordingly. Aiming at improving the quality and update rate of road information, a hot topic today is how to mine information from global positioning systems (GPS) trajectories by the clustering-based methods. Such schemes, however, encounter two challenges: 1) GPS noise and 2) low sampling rate of GPS traces data. As a result, it is difficult to infer road information from these irregular clusters. To tackle the above issues, we directly mine useful road information, heading, and width of roads, for ITS applications from GPS point cloud, i.e., a set of GPS points. First, the distribution of GPS points is discussed and the least squares method (LSM) is demonstrated to be outstanding for mining the heading of the road under a huge number of GPS points. Second, the weighted approximation least squares method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the LSM. Furthermore, combining with relevant distribution features in GPS points, the data distribution variance-road width discrete model is proposed to mine road width from GPS point cloud. Finally, using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that these proposed methods can achieve satisfactory performance in practice."

This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system."

A case study is conducted for an occupational medicine problem with the purpose of analyzing patterns in a population of 813 individuals. To reduce the data set dimensionality, we base our approach on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is the statistical tool most commonly used in factorial analysis. However, the problems in nature, especially in medicine, are often based on heterogeneous-type qualitative-quantitative measurements, whereas PCA only processes quantitative ones. Besides, qualitative data are originally unobservable quantitative responses that are usually binary-coded. Hence, we propose a new set of strategies allowing to simultaneously handle quantitative and qualitative data. The principle of this approach is to perform a projection of the qualitative variables on the subspaces spanned by quantitative ones. Subsequently, an optimal model is allocated to the resulting PCA-regressed subspaces."

Traditionally, it is either assumed that the time-ordered location data recorded as trajectories are either deterministic or that the uncertainty, e.g., due to equipment or technological limitations, is removed by incorporating some pre-processing routines. Thus, the trajectories are processed as deterministic paths of mobile object location data. However, it is important to understand that the transformation from uncertain to deterministic trajectory data may result in the loss of information about the level of confidence in the recorded events. Probabilistic databases offer ways to model uncertainties using possible world semantics. In this paper, we consider uncertain sensor data and transform this to probabilistic trajectory data using pre-processing routines. Next, we model this data as tuple level uncertain data and propose dynamic programming-based algorithms to mine interesting trajectories. A comprehensive empirical study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that the trajectories could be modeled and worked as probabilistic data and that the results could be computed efficiently using dynamic programming."

How to extract effective information from educational big data and realize adaptive personalized learning goals have become the current research hotspot. The traditional static data only analyzes the students' learning degree based on the students' final answer, but ignores the dynamic data in the process of answering questions, such as the modification and the time it answered on the question, which makes it difficult to fully and accurately mine the correlation between the massive data, so it turns from static data mining to dynamic data mining. The paper proposes an optimized mining algorithm for analyzing students' learning degree based on dynamic data. The algorithm first uses the optimized text classification technology to match the question texts to the knowledge points automatically, so as to improves the efficiency and quality. Then, it uses the subjective weighting method combined with the expert experience to generate the learning degree matrix of students on knowledge points based on dynamic data of the students' records. Finally, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to cluster the personalized learning characteristics of students according to the learning degree matrix. The experimental result shows that the algorithm can deal with massive data automatically and effectively, and analyze the students' learning degree on knowledge points comprehensively and accurately, so as to classify students and realize personalized teaching."

The static load-balancing is done by measuring the computational time using a probabilistic algorithm. For reasonable size of instance, the algorithms achieve speedups up to \n≈3\/4⋅P\n where \n P \n is the number of processors.

Frequent itemset mining (FIM), as an important step of association rule analysis, is becoming one of the most important research fields in data mining. Weighted FIM in uncertain databases should take both existential probability and importance of items into account in order to find frequent itemsets of great importance to users. However, the introduction of weight makes the weighted frequent itemsets not satisfy the downward closure property any longer. As a result, the search space of frequent itemsets cannot be narrowed according to downward closure property which leads to a poor time efficiency. In this paper, the weight judgment downward closure property for the weighted frequent itemsets and the existence property of weighted frequent subsets are introduced and proved first. Based on these two properties, the Weight judgment downward closure property-based FIM (WD-FIM) algorithm is proposed to narrow the searching space of the weighted frequent itemsets and improve the time efficiency. Moreover, the completeness and time efficiency of WD-FIM algorithm are analyzed theoretically. Finally, the performance of the proposed WD-FIM algorithm is verified on both synthetic and real-life data sets."

To cope with data noise, repeated experiments are often conducted to collect multiple measurements. We propose and study a more robust version of OPSM, where each data item is represented by a set of values obtained from replicated experiments. We call the new problem OPSM-RM (OPSM with repeated measurements). We define OPSM-RM based on a number of practical requirements.

In this paper, the design of an incremental warping window is used to improve the performance of dynamic time warping. The incremental warping window is changeable for various time series with different lengths. Moreover, the improved dynamic time warping based on the novel window considers the recent alignments as much as possible, which indicates that the proposed method concentrates on more information of the recent data points than that of the previous data points. In addition, it is suitable for online similarity measure between data stream. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method is effective and efficient for time series mining."

In this paper, based on the Haar wavelet, a class of nonorthogonal multichannel filter bank with its corresponding wavelet shrinkage called Lee shrinkage is derived. As a special case of this filter bank, the double Haar wavelet transform is introduced.

The core idea is to decompose the target image into fully overlapping patches, restore each of them separately, and then merge the results by a plain averaging. This concept has been demonstrated to be highly effective, leading often times to the state-of-the-art results in denoising, inpainting, deblurring, segmentation, and other applications. While the above is indeed effective, this approach has one major flaw: the prior is imposed on intermediate (patch) results, rather than on the final outcome, and this is typically manifested by visual artifacts. The expected patch log likelihood (EPLL) method by Zoran and Weiss was conceived for addressing this very problem. Their algorithm imposes the prior on the patches of the \nfinal image\n, which in turn leads to an iterative restoration of diminishing effect. In this paper, we propose to further extend and improve the EPLL by considering a multi-scale prior. Our algorithm imposes the very same prior on different scale patches extracted from the target image. While all the treated patches are of the same size, their footprint in the destination image varies due to subsampling. Our scheme comes to alleviate another shortcoming existing in patch-based restoration algorithms—the fact that a local (patch-based) prior is serving as a model for a global stochastic phenomenon. We motivate the use of the multi-scale EPLL by restricting ourselves to the simple Gaussian case, comparing the aforementioned algorithms and showing a clear advantage to the proposed method. We then demonstrate our algorithm in the context of image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, showing an improvement in performance both visually and quantitatively."

However, existing methods assume homogeneity in the imaged medium, neglecting the heterogeneity in sound velocities and densities present in real tissues, resulting in noise reverberation. This study introduces the Reverse Time Migration (RTM) method for ultrasound plane-wave imaging to overcome this limitation, which is combined with a method for estimating the speed of sound in layered media. Simulation results in a homogeneous background demonstrate that RTM reduces side lobes and grating lobes by approximately 30 dB, enhancing the contrast-to-noise ratio by 20% compared to conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamforming. Moreover, RTM achieves superior imaging outcomes with fewer compounding angles. The lateral resolution of the RTM with 5–9 angle compounding is able to achieve the effectiveness of the DAS method with 15–19 angle compounding, and the CNR of the RTM with 11-angle compounding is almost the same as that of the DAS with 21-angle compounding. In a heterogeneous background, experimental simulations and in vitro wire phantom experiments confirm RTM's capability to correct depth imaging, focusing reflected waves on point targets. In vitro porcine tissue experiments enable accurate imaging of layer interfaces by estimating the velocities of multiple layers containing muscle and fat. The proposed imaging procedure optimizes velocity estimation in complex media, compensates for the impact of velocity differences, provides more reliable imaging results."

Several smoothing approaches have been used at the pre-processing step to retain the critical edge, while removing noise and small details. However, they have limited performance, especially in removing small details and smoothing discrete regions. Therefore, to provide fast and accurate smoothing, we propose an effective scheme that uses a weighted combination of the gradient, Laplacian, and diagonal derivatives of a smoothed image. In addition, to reduce computational complexity, we designed and implemented a parallel processing structure for the proposed scheme on a graphics processing unit (GPU). For an objective evaluation of the smoothing performance, the images were linearly quantized into several layers to generate experimental images, and the quantized images were smoothed using several methods for reconstructing the smoothly changed shape and intensity of the original image. Experimental results showed that the proposed scheme has higher objective scores and better successful smoothing performance than similar schemes, while preserving and removing critical and trivial details, respectively. For computational complexity, the proposed smoothing scheme running on a GPU provided 18 and 16 times lower complexity than the proposed smoothing scheme running on a CPU and the L0-based smoothing scheme, respectively. In addition, a simple noise reduction test was conducted to show the characteristics of the proposed approach; it reported that the presented algorithm outperforms the state-of-the art algorithms by more than 5.4 dB. Therefore, we believe that the proposed scheme can be a useful tool for efficient image smoothing."

Due to the tomographic detection geometry, the PAT image degradation model could be generally described by using spatially variant PSFs. Deconvolution of the PAT image with these PSFs could restore image resolution and recover object details. Previous PAT image restoration algorithms assume that the degraded images can be restored by either a single uniform PSF, or some blind estimation of the spatially variant PSFs. In this work, we propose a PAT image restoration method to improve image quality and resolution based on experimentally measured spatially variant PSFs. Using photoacoustic absorbing microspheres, we design a rigorous PSF measurement procedure, and successfully acquire a dense set of spatially variant PSFs for a commercial cross-sectional PAT system. A pixel-wise PSF map is further obtained by employing a multi-Gaussian-based fitting and interpolation algorithm. To perform image restoration, an optimization-based iterative restoration model with two kinds of regularizations is proposed.

In automated breast volume scanners (ABVSs), which suffer from reduced volume rates, CPWCI might be an excellent candidate to replace CFI. Therefore, the image quality of CFI currently in ABVS and CPWCI was also compared in an \nin vivo\n breast lesion.

Phantom results showed that contrast sensitivity and resolution, axial resolution, and generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR; imaging depths <45 mm) were similar for most imaging sequences. CNR (imaging depths ≥45 mm), penetration, and lateral resolution were significantly improved for CPWCI (15 angles) compared to CFI for both transducers. In CPWCI, certain combinations of steering angles and beamforming methods yielded improved gCNR (small angles and delay-and-sum) or lateral resolution (large angles and Lu’s-fk).

Some of the most popular segmentation methods (e.g. based on convolutional neural networks or random forest classifiers) incorporate additional post-processing steps to ensure that the resulting masks fulfill expected connectivity constraints. These methods operate under the hypothesis that contiguous pixels with similar aspect should belong to the same class. Even if valid in general, this assumption does not consider more complex priors like topological restrictions or convexity, which cannot be easily incorporated into these methods. Post-DAE leverages the latest developments in manifold learning via denoising autoencoders. First, we learn a compact and non-linear embedding that represents the space of anatomically plausible segmentations. Then, given a segmentation mask obtained with an arbitrary method, we reconstruct its anatomically plausible version by projecting it onto the learnt manifold. The proposed method is trained using unpaired segmentation mask, what makes it independent of intensity information and image modality. We performed experiments in binary and multi-label segmentation of chest X-ray and cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show how erroneous and noisy segmentation masks can be improved using Post-DAE. With almost no additional computation cost, our method brings erroneous segmentations back to a feasible space."

We quantitatively and qualitatively compare with existing methods and show that our method provides better signal-to-noise ratio and increases the resolution of the reconstructed images."

  "abstrak": "Ultrafast imaging based on plane-wave (PW) insonification is an active area of research due to its capability of reaching high frame rates. Among PW imaging methods, Fourier-based approaches have demonstrated to be competitive compared with traditional delay and sum methods. Motivated by the success of compressed sensing techniques in other Fourier imaging modalities, like magnetic resonance imaging, we propose a new sparse regularization framework to reconstruct high-quality ultrasound (US) images. The framework takes advantage of both the ability to formulate the imaging inverse problem in the Fourier domain and the sparsity of US images in a sparsifying domain. We show, by means of simulations, in vitro and in vivo data, that the proposed framework significantly reduces image artifacts, i.e., measurement noise and sidelobes, compared with classical methods, leading to an increase of the image quality."

  "abstrak": "The dynamic range of an image is defined as the ratio between the highest and the lowest luminance level. In a high dynamic range (HDR) image, this value exceeds the capabilities of conventional display devices; as a consequence, dedicated visualization techniques are required. In particular, it is possible to process an HDR image in order to reduce its dynamic range without producing a significant change in the visual sensation experienced by the observer. In this paper, we propose a dynamic range reduction algorithm that produces high-quality results with a low computational cost and a limited number of parameters. The algorithm belongs to the category of methods based upon the Retinex theory of vision and was specifically designed in order to prevent the formation of common artifacts, such as halos around the sharp edges and clipping of the highlights, that often affect methods of this kind. After a detailed analysis of the state of the art, we shall describe the method and compare the results and performance with those of two techniques recently proposed in the literature and one commercial software."

  "abstrak": "We introduce a novel edge tracing algorithm using Gaussian process regression. Our edge-based segmentation algorithm models an edge of interest using Gaussian process regression and iteratively searches the image for edge pixels in a recursive Bayesian scheme. This procedure combines local edge information from the image gradient and global structural information from posterior curves, sampled from the model’s posterior predictive distribution, to sequentially build and refine an observation set of edge pixels. This accumulation of pixels converges the distribution to the edge of interest. Hyperparameters can be tuned by the user at initialisation and optimised given the refined observation set. This tunable approach does not require any prior training and is not restricted to any particular type of imaging domain. Due to the model’s uncertainty quantification, the algorithm is robust to artefacts and occlusions which degrade the quality and continuity of edges in images. Our approach also has the ability to efficiently trace edges in image sequences by using previous-image edge traces as a priori information for consecutive images. Various applications to medical imaging and satellite imaging are used to validate the technique and comparisons are made with two commonly used edge tracing algorithms."

  "abstrak": "As an emerging molecular imaging modality, Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is capable of mapping tissue physiological metabolism and exogenous contrast agent information with high specificity. Due to its ultrasonic detection mechanism, the precise localization of targeted lesions has long been a challenge for PAT imaging. The poor soft-tissue contrast of the PAT image makes this process difficult and inaccurate. To meet this challenge, in this study, we first make use of the rich and clear structural information brought about by another advanced imaging modality, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), to assist organ segmentation and correct for the light fluence attenuation of PAT. We demonstrate improved feature visibility and enhanced localization of endogenous and exogenous agents in the fluence corrected PAT images. Compared with PAT-based methods, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of our MRI-assisted method increases by 29.1% in live animal experiments. Furthermore, we show that the co-registered MRI image can also be incorporated into PAT image restoration, and achieves improved anatomical landscape and soft-tissue contrast (CNR increased by 25.36%) while preserving similar spatial resolution. This PAT-MRI combination provides excellent structural, functional and molecular images of the subject, and may enable more comprehensive analysis of various preclinical research applications."

  "abstrak": "It is well known that the performance of context-based image processing systems can be improved by allowing the processor (e.g., an encoder or a denoiser) a delay of several samples before making a processing decision. Often, however, for such systems, traditional delayed-decision algorithms can become computationally prohibitive due to the growth in the size of the space of possible solutions. In this paper, we propose a reduced-complexity, one-pass, delayed-decision algorithm that systematically reduces the size of the search space, while also preserving its structure. In particular, we apply the proposed algorithm to two examples of adaptive context-based image processing systems, an image coding system that employs a context-based entropy coder, and a spatially adaptive image-denoising system. For these two types of widely used systems, we show that the proposed delayed-decision search algorithm outperforms instantaneous-decision algorithms with only a small increase in complexity. We also show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of other, higher complexity, delayed-decision algorithms."

The cMI measure was incorporated in a tensor-product \nB\n-spline nonrigid registration method, using either a Parzen window or generalized partial volume kernel for histogram construction. cMI was compared to the classical global mutual information (gMI) approach in theoretical, phantom, and clinical settings. We show that cMI significantly outperforms gMI for all applications."

Firstly, we present a novel approach to AUHB-DWR that aims to improve image quality. We formulate the reconstruction of an apparent DW image as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) in which tissue model diffusion parameters act as hidden states in this random field. The second contribution of this paper is a new generation of fully connected conditional random fields, called the hidden stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (HSFCRF) that allows for efficient inference with significantly reduced computational complexity via stochastic clique structures. The proposed AUHB-DWR algorithms, HCRF and HSFCRF, are evaluated quantitatively in nine different patient cases using Fisher's criteria, probability of error, and coefficient of variation metrics to validate its effectiveness for the purpose of improving intensity delineation between expert identified suspected cancerous and healthy tissue within the prostate gland. The proposed methods are also examined using a prostate phantom, where the apparent ultra-high b-value DW images reconstructed using the tested AUHB-DWR methods are compared with real captured UHB-DWI. The results illustrate that the proposed AUHB-DWR methods has improved reconstruction quality and improved intensity delineation compared with existing AUHB-DWR approaches."

  "abstrak": "Spine parsing (i.e., multi-class segmentation of vertebrae and intervertebral discs (IVDs)) for volumetric magnetic resonance (MR) image plays a significant role in various spinal disease diagnoses and treatments of spine disorders, yet is still a challenge due to the inter-class similarity and intra-class variation of spine images. Existing fully convolutional network based methods failed to explicitly exploit the dependencies between different spinal structures. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SpineParseNet to achieve automated spine parsing for volumetric MR images. The SpineParseNet consists of a 3D graph convolutional segmentation network (GCSN) for 3D coarse segmentation and a 2D residual U-Net (ResUNet) for 2D segmentation refinement. In 3D GCSN, region pooling is employed to project the image representation to graph representation, in which each node representation denotes a specific spinal structure. The adjacency matrix of the graph is designed according to the connection of spinal structures. The graph representation is evolved by graph convolutions. Subsequently, the proposed region unpooling module re-projects the evolved graph representation to a semantic image representation, which facilitates the 3D GCSN to generate reliable coarse segmentation. Finally, the 2D ResUNet refines the segmentation. Experiments on T2-weighted volumetric MR images of 215 subjects show that SpineParseNet achieves impressive performance with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 87.32 ± 4.75%, 87.78 ± 4.64%, and 87.49 ± 3.81% for the segmentations of 10 vertebrae, 9 IVDs, and all 19 spinal structures respectively. The proposed method has great potential in clinical spinal disease diagnoses and treatments."

Areal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an established criterion in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. This measure, however, is limited by its two-dimensionality. This work presents a method to reconstruct both the 3D bone shape and 3D BMD distribution of the proximal femur from a single DXA image used in clinical routine. A statistical model of the combined shape and BMD distribution is presented, together with a method for its construction from a set of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans. A reconstruction is acquired in an intensity based 3D-2D registration process whereby an instance of the model is found that maximizes the similarity between its projection and the DXA image. Reconstruction experiments were performed on the DXA images of 30 subjects, with a model constructed from a database of QCT scans of 85 subjects. The accuracy was evaluated by comparing the reconstructions with the same subject QCT scans. The method presented here can potentially improve the diagnosis of osteoporosis and fracture risk assessment from the low radiation dose and low cost DXA devices currently used in clinical routine."

The seed pixels are used to estimate the labels of the unlabeled pixels using Dirichlet process multiple-view learning, which leverages 1) multiple-view learning that integrates appearance and boundary constraints and 2) Dirichlet process mixture-based nonlinear classification that simultaneously models image features and discriminates between the object and background classes. With the proposed learning and inference algorithms, our segmentation framework is experimentally shown to produce both quantitatively and qualitatively promising results on a standard dataset of images. In particular, our proposed framework is able to segment whole objects from images given insufficient seeds."

This model is inspired by the functions that appear in partition of unity in the differential geometry field. When observing images captured in fog conditions, usually the fog has a very low density in front of the camera and this density has a nonlinear increase with the distance, such that objects are no longer visible at greater distances. By using our mathematical model, we are able to obtain superior reconstructions of the original fog-free image when compared with traditional methods. Another advantage of our method is the ability to adapt the model in accordance to the density of the fog. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed on both synthetic and real camera images. This evaluation proves that our mathematical model is more suitable for contrast restoration in both homogeneous and heterogeneous fog conditions. Our algorithm is able to perform contrast restoration in real time for both color and grayscale images."

More specifically, the number of emissions and steering angles is optimized to attain the best images with the highest frame rate possible. The method is applied to a specific problem, where image quality for a λ-pitch transducer is compared with a λ\/2-pitch transducer. Grating lobe artifacts for λ-pitch transducers degrade the contrast in plane wave images, and the impact on frame rate is studied. FieldII simulations of plane wave images are made for all combinations of the parameters, and the optimal setup is selected based on Pareto optimality. The optimal setup for a simulated 4.1-MHz λ-pitch transducer uses 61 emissions and a maximum steering angle of 20° for depths from 0 to 60 mm. The achieved lateral full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is 1.5λ and the contrast is -29 dB for a scatterer at 9 mm (24λ). Using a λ\/2-pitch transducer and only 21 emissions within the same angle range, the image quality is improved in terms of contrast, which is -37 dB. For imaging in regions deeper than 25 mm (66λ), only 21 emissions are optimal for both the transducers, resulting in a -36 dB contrast at 34 mm (90λ). Measurements are performed using the experimental SARUS scanner connected to a λ-pitch and λ\/2-pitch transducer. A wire phantom and a tissue mimicking phantom containing anechoic cysts are scanned and show the performance using the optimized sequences for the transducers. FWHM is 1.6λ and contrast is -25 dB for a wire at 9 mm using the λ-pitch transducer. For the λ\/2-pitch transducer, contrast is -29 dB. In vivo scans of the carotid artery of a healthy volunteer show improved contrast and present fewer artifacts, when using the λ\/2-pitch transducer compared with the λ-pitch. It is demonstrated with a frame rate, which is three times higher for the λ\/2-pitch transducer."

In image registration, one looks for the underlying deformation field that best maps one image onto another. This is a classic ill-posed inverse problem, which is usually solved by adding a regularization term. Here, we propose a multiplicative coupling between the registration term and the regularization term, which turns out to be equivalent to embed the deformation field in a weighted minimal surface problem. Then, the deformation field is driven by a minimization flow toward a harmonic map corresponding to the solution of the registration problem. This proposed approach for registration shares close similarities with the well-known geodesic active contours model in image segmentation, where the segmentation term (the edge detector function) is coupled with the regularization term (the length functional) via multiplication as well. As a matter of fact, our proposed geometric model is actually the exact mathematical generalization to vector fields of the weighted length problem for curves and surfaces introduced by Caselles-Kimmel-Sapiro. The energy of the deformation field is measured with the Polyakov energy weighted by a suitable image distance, borrowed from standard registration models. We investigate three different weighting functions, the squared error and the approximated absolute error for monomodal images, and the local joint entropy for multimodal images. As compared to specialized state-of-the-art methods tailored for specific applications, our geometric framework involves important contributions. Firstly, our general formulation for registration works on any parametrizable, smooth and differentiable surface, including nonflat and multiscale images.

The proposed network makes full use of different levels of features by using the difference values (D-values) of adjacent layers. Specifically, a difference value block (DVB) is designed to extract the difference values of adjacent layers. The extracted difference value can highlight which regions should be paid more attention to, so as to guide image SR. Further, a difference value group (DVG) is designed to integrate the difference values extracted by the difference value block into its output. In this way, the DVG can provide additional structure prior for image SR. Finally, to make our network more stable, a multipath supervised reconstruction block is proposed to supervise the reconstruction process. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed network can achieve better reconstruction results than the compared SR methods."

Segmentation has been further shown to enhance the reconstruction performance in many tomographic imaging modalities by accounting for heterogeneities in the excitation field and tissue properties in the imaged region. This is particularly relevant in optoacoustic tomography, where discontinuities in the optical and acoustic tissue properties, if not properly accounted for, may result in deterioration of the imaging performance. Efficient segmentation of optoacoustic images is often hampered by the relatively low intrinsic contrast of large anatomical structures, which is further impaired by the limited angular coverage of some commonly employed tomographic imaging configurations. Herein, we analyze the performance of active contour models for boundary segmentation in cross-sectional optoacoustic tomography. The segmented mask is employed to construct a two compartment model for the acoustic and optical parameters of the imaged tissues, which is subsequently used to improve accuracy of the image reconstruction routines. The performance of the suggested segmentation and modeling approach are showcased in tissue-mimicking phantoms and small animal imaging experiments."

In standard x-space approach to MPI, the image is reconstructed by gridding the speed-compensated nanoparticle signal to the instantaneous position of the field free point (FFP). However, due to safety limits on the drive field, the field-of-view (FOV) needs to be covered by multiple relatively small partial field-of-views (pFOVs). The image of the entire FOV is then pieced together from individually processed pFOVs. These processing steps can be sensitive to non-ideal signal conditions such as harmonic interference, noise, and relaxation effects. In this work, we propose a robust x-space reconstruction technique, Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI), with substantially simplified pFOV processing. PCI first forms a raw image of the entire FOV by mapping MPI signal directly to pFOV center locations. The corresponding MPI image is then obtained by deconvolving this raw image by a compact kernel, whose fully-known shape solely depends on the pFOV size. We analyze the performance of the proposed reconstruction via extensive simulations, as well as imaging experiments on our in-house FFP MPI scanner. The results show that PCI offers a trade-off between noise robustness and interference robustness, outperforming standard x-space reconstruction in terms of both robustness against non-ideal signal conditions and image quality."

In this paper, we present a unified Bayesian framework to iteratively discovering semantic segments from PAN images and allocating cluster labels for the segments using MS images. Specifically, the probabilistic generative process of both PAN and MS images is explained with a generalized metaphor of the Chinese restaurant franchise (CRF) (gCRF), in which the two iterative random processes, i.e., table selection and dish selection, are adapted to discovering semantic segments in PAN images and inferring cluster labels for the discovered segments using MS images, respectively. Our major contributions are twofold: 1) The CRF is generalized into an image fusion framework by elegantly decomposing its two random processes, and 2) the random process of table selection in the CRF is transformed into stochastic image segmentation by enforcing spatial constraints over adjacent pixels. The qualitative analysis of experimental results shows that the gCRF can effectively utilize both the spatial details of the PAN images and the spectral information of the MS images.

An increasing number of methods has been proposed for MR-to-CT synthesis. However, synthesizing CT images of different anatomical regions from MR images with different sequences using a single model is challenging due to the large differences between these regions and the limitations of convolutional neural networks in capturing global context information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale tokens-aware Transformer network (MTT-Net) for multi-region and multi-sequence MR-to-CT synthesis in a single model. Specifically, we develop a multi-scale image tokens Transformer to capture multi-scale global spatial information between different anatomical structures in different regions. Besides, to address the limited attention areas of tokens in Transformer, we introduce a multi-shape window self-attention into Transformer to enlarge the receptive fields for learning the multi-directional spatial representations. Moreover, we adopt a domain classifier in generator to introduce the domain knowledge for distinguishing the MR images of different regions and sequences.

These moments have also been digitized for applications in digital image processing. Unfortunately, digitization compromises the orthogonality of the moments and, therefore, digital ORIMs are incapable of representing subtle details in images and cannot accurately reconstruct images. Typical approaches to alleviate the digitization artifact can be divided into two categories: 1) careful selection of a set of pixels as close approximation to the unit disk and using numerical integration to determine the ORIM values, and 2) representing pixels using circular shapes such that they resemble that of the unit disk and then calculating ORIMs in polar space. These improvements still fall short of preserving the orthogonality of the ORIMs. In this paper, in contrast to the previous methods, we propose a different approach of using numerical optimization techniques to improve the orthogonality. We prove that with the improved orthogonality, image reconstruction becomes more accurate. Our simulation results also show that the optimized digital ORIMs can accurately reconstruct images and can represent subtle image details."

Thus, improving the quality of low-count images by using image postprocessing algorithms to achieve better clinical diagnoses has attracted widespread attention in the medical imaging community. Most existing deep learning-based low-count PET image enhancement methods have achieved satisfying results, however, few of them focus on denoising low-count PET images with the magnetic resonance (MR) image modality as guidance. The prior context features contained in MR images can provide abundant and complementary information for single low-count PET image denoising, especially in ultralow-count (2.5%) cases. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream dual PET\/MR cross-modal interactive fusion network with an optical flow pre-alignment module, namely, OIF-Net. Specifically, the learnable optical flow registration module enables the spatial manipulation of MR imaging inputs within the network without any extra training supervision. Registered MR images fundamentally solve the problem of feature misalignment in the multimodal fusion stage, which greatly benefits the subsequent denoising process. In addition, we design a spatial-channel feature enhancement module (SC-FEM) that considers the interactive impacts of multiple modalities and provides additional information flexibility in both the spatial and channel dimensions. Furthermore, instead of simply concatenating two extracted features from these two modalities as an intermediate fusion method, the proposed cross-modal feature fusion module (CM-FFM) adopts cross-attention at multiple feature levels and greatly improves the two modalities’ feature fusion procedure. Extensive experimental assessments conducted on real clinical datasets, as well as an independent clinical testing dataset, demonstrate that the proposed OIF-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

Adopting the integer linear programming-based formulation for the protein structure prediction problem, we tested the proposed technique using 30 visualizations produced from five patient scans with representative anatomical variants in the abdominal aortic vessel tree. The novel technique can exploit commodity-level parallelism, enabling use of general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) technology that yields a significant speedup. Comparison of the results with the other optimization technique previously reported elsewhere suggests that, in most aspects, the quality of the visualization is comparable to that of the previous one, with a significant gain in the computation time of the algorithm."

  "abstrak": "Connections in image processing are an important notion that describes how pixels can be grouped together according to their spatial relationships and\/or their gray-level values. In recent years, several works were devoted to the development of new theories of connections among which hyperconnection (h-connection) is a very promising notion. This paper addresses two major issues of this theory. First, we propose a new axiomatic that ensures that every h-connection generates decompositions that are consistent for image processing and, more precisely, for the design of h-connected filters. Second, we develop a general framework to represent the decomposition of an image into h-connections as a tree that corresponds to the generalization of the connected component tree. Such trees are indeed an efficient and intuitive way to design attribute filters or to perform detection tasks based on qualitative or quantitative attributes. These theoretical developments are applied to a particular fuzzy h-connection, and we test this new framework on several classical applications in image processing, i.e., segmentation, connected filtering, and document image binarization. The experiments confirm the suitability of the proposed approach: It is robust to noise, and it provides an efficient framework to design selective filters."

We are guided by the theory of sparse stochastic processes, which specifies continuous-domain signals as solutions of linear stochastic differential equations. Accordingly, we show that the class of admissible priors for the discretized version of the signal is confined to the family of infinitely divisible distributions. Our estimators not only cover the well-studied methods of Tikhonov and \nl\n1\n-type regularizations as particular cases, but also open the door to a broader class of sparsity-promoting regularization schemes that are typically nonconvex. We provide an algorithm that handles the corresponding nonconvex problems and illustrate the use of our formalism by applying it to deconvolution, magnetic resonance imaging, and X-ray tomographic reconstruction problems. Finally, we compare the performance of estimators associated with models of increasing sparsity."

  "abstrak": "Deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks, have been successfully applied to lesion segmentation in breast ultrasound (BUS) images. However, pattern complexity and intensity similarity between the surrounding tissues (i.e., background) and lesion regions (i.e., foreground) bring challenges for lesion segmentation. Considering that such rich texture information is contained in background, very few methods have tried to explore and exploit background-salient representations for assisting foreground segmentation. Additionally, other characteristics of BUS images, i.e., 1) low-contrast appearance and blurry boundary, and 2) significant shape and position variation of lesions, also increase the difficulty in accurate lesion segmentation. In this paper, we present a saliency-guided morphology-aware U-Net (SMU-Net) for lesion segmentation in BUS images. The SMU-Net is composed of a main network with an additional middle stream and an auxiliary network. Specifically, we first propose generation of saliency maps which incorporate both low-level and high-level image structures, for foreground and background. These saliency maps are then employed to guide the main network and auxiliary network for respectively learning foreground-salient and background-salient representations. Furthermore, we devise an additional middle stream which basically consists of background-assisted fusion, shape-aware, edge-aware and position-aware units. This stream receives the coarse-to-fine representations from the main network and auxiliary network for efficiently fusing the foreground-salient and background-salient features and enhancing the ability of learning morphological information for network. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate higher performance and superior robustness to the scale of dataset than several state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in breast lesion segmentation in ultrasound image."

Through Voronoi subdivision, we subdivide large images into small corresponding regions, and by registering small regions, we register the images in a piecewise manner. Image subdivision reduces the geometric difference between regions that are registered and simplifies the correspondence process. The proposed method is a hierarchical one. While previous methods use the same block size and shape at a hierarchy, the proposed method adapts the block size and shape to the local image details and geometric difference between the images. This adaptation makes it possible to keep geometric difference between corresponding regions small and simplifies the correspondence process. Implementational details of the proposed image registration method are provided, and experimental results on various types of images are presented and analyzed."

  "abstrak": "Thanks to its capability of acquiring full-view frames at multiple kilohertz, ultrafast ultrasound imaging unlocked the analysis of rapidly changing physical phenomena in the human body, with pioneering applications such as ultrasensitive flow imaging in the cardiovascular system or shear-wave elastography. The accuracy achievable with these motion estimation techniques is strongly contingent upon two contradictory requirements: a high quality of consecutive frames and a high frame rate. Indeed, the image quality can usually be improved by increasing the number of steered ultrafast acquisitions, but at the expense of a reduced frame rate and possible motion artifacts. To achieve accurate motion estimation at uncompromised frame rates and immune to motion artifacts, the proposed approach relies on single ultrafast acquisitions to reconstruct high-quality frames and on only two consecutive frames to obtain 2-D displacement estimates. To this end, we deployed a convolutional neural network-based image reconstruction method combined with a speckle tracking algorithm based on cross-correlation. Numerical and in vivo experiments, conducted in the context of plane-wave imaging, demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of estimating displacements in regions where the presence of side lobe and grating lobe artifacts prevents any displacement estimation with a state-of-the-art technique that relies on conventional delay-and-sum beamforming. The proposed approach may therefore unlock the full potential of ultrafast ultrasound, in applications such as ultrasensitive cardiovascular motion and flow analysis or shear-wave elastography."

The objective of this study is to develop and show the feasibility of a novel fast beamforming algorithm for image reconstruction using GPU-based sparse-matrix operation with real-time feedback. In this study, the algorithm was implemented onto a fully integrated, clinically relevant HMIFU system. A single divergent transmit beam was used while fast beamforming was implemented using a GPU-based delay-and-sum method and a sparse-matrix operation. Axial HMI displacements were then estimated from the RF signals using a 1-D normalized cross-correlation method and streamed to a graphic user interface with frame rates up to 15 Hz, a 100-fold increase compared to conventional CPU-based processing. The real-time feedback rate does not require interrupting the HIFU treatment. Results in phantom experiments showed reproducible HMI images and monitoring of 22 in vitro HIFU treatments using the new 2-D system demonstrated reproducible displacement imaging, and monitoring of 22 in vitro HIFU treatments using the new 2-D system showed a consistent average focal displacement decrease of 46.7 ±14.6% during lesion formation. Complementary focal temperature monitoring also indicated an average rate of displacement increase and decrease with focal temperature at 0.84±1.15%\/ ° C, and 2.03±0.93%\/ ° C, respectively.

An increasing number of methods has been proposed for MR-to-CT synthesis. However, synthesizing CT images of different anatomical regions from MR images with different sequences using a single model is challenging due to the large differences between these regions and the limitations of convolutional neural networks in capturing global context information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale tokens-aware Transformer network (MTT-Net) for multi-region and multi-sequence MR-to-CT synthesis in a single model. Specifically, we develop a multi-scale image tokens Transformer to capture multi-scale global spatial information between different anatomical structures in different regions. Besides, to address the limited attention areas of tokens in Transformer, we introduce a multi-shape window self-attention into Transformer to enlarge the receptive fields for learning the multi-directional spatial representations. Moreover, we adopt a domain classifier in generator to introduce the domain knowledge for distinguishing the MR images of different regions and sequences. The proposed MTT-Net is evaluated on a multi-center dataset and an unseen region, and remarkable performance was achieved with MAE of 69.33 ± 10.39 HU, SSIM of 0.778 ± 0.028, and PSNR of 29.04 ± 1.32 dB in head & neck region, and MAE of 62.80 ± 7.65 HU, SSIM of 0.617 ± 0.058 and PSNR of 25.94 ± 1.02 dB in abdomen region.

The continuous-domain image is assumed to be a smooth function, and we embed it in a parameterized Sobolev space. We point out a link between Sobolev spaces and stochastic auto-regressive models, and exploit it for optimally choosing Sobolev parameters from available pixel values. To this aim, we use exact continuous-to-discrete mapping of the auto-regressive model that is based on symmetric exponential splines. The mapping is computationally efficient, and we exploit it for maximizing an approximated Gaussian likelihood function. We account for non-Gaussian Lévy-type processes by deriving a more robust estimator that is based on the sample auto-correlation sequence. Both estimators use multiple initialization values for overcoming the local minima structure of the fitting criteria. Experimental image resizing results indicate that the auto-correlation criterion can cope better with non-Gaussian processes and model mismatch. Our work demonstrates the importance of the auto-correlation function in adaptive image interpolation and image modeling tasks, and we believe it is instrumental in other image processing tasks as well."

As an example, we focus on aligning intra-subject multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (mpMR) images, between T2-weighted (T2w) scans and diffusion-weighted scans with high b-value (DWI\n high-b \n). For the application of localising tumours in mpMR images, diffusion scans with zero b-value (DWI\n b=0 \n) are considered easier to register to T2w due to the availability of corresponding features. We propose a learning from privileged modality algorithm, using a training-only imaging modality DWI\n b=0 \n, to support the challenging multi-modality registration problems. We present experimental results based on 369 sets of 3D multiparametric MRI images from 356 prostate cancer patients and report, with statistical significance, a lowered median target registration error of 4.34 mm, when registering the holdout DWI\n high-b \n and T2w image pairs, compared with that of 7.96 mm before registration. Results also show that the proposed learning-based registration networks enabled efficient registration with comparable or better accuracy, compared with a classical iterative algorithm and other tested learning-based methods with\/without the additional modality. These compared algorithms also failed to produce any significantly improved alignment between DWI\n high-b \n and T2w in this challenging application."

In this paper, we present a goal-oriented rectification methodology to compensate for undesirable document image distortions aiming to improve the OCR result. Our approach relies upon a coarse-to-fine strategy. First, a coarse rectification is accomplished with the aid of a computationally low cost transformation which addresses the projection of a curved surface to a 2-D rectangular area. The projection of the curved surface on the plane is guided only by the textual content's appearance in the document image while incorporating a transformation which does not depend on specific model primitives or camera setup parameters. Second, pose normalization is applied on the word level aiming to restore all the local distortions of the document image. Experimental results on various document images with a variety of distortions demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed rectification methodology using a consistent evaluation methodology that encounters OCR accuracy and a newly introduced measure using a semi-automatic procedure."

Besides, multichannel feature images can be derived from acquired images, for instance, by applying multiscale feature banks to the original images to register. Multichannel registration techniques have been proposed, but most of them are applicable to only two multichannel images at a time. In the present study, we propose to formulate multichannel registration as a groupwise image registration problem. In this way, we derive a method that allows the registration of two or more multichannel images in a fully symmetric manner (i.e., all images play the same role in the registration procedure), and therefore, has transitive consistency by definition. The method that we introduce is applicable to any number of multichannel images, any number of channels per image, and it allows to take into account correlation between any pair of images and not just corresponding channels. In addition, it is fully modular in terms of dissimilarity measure, transformation model, regularisation method, and optimisation strategy. For two multimodal datasets, we computed feature images from the initially acquired images, and applied the proposed registration technique to the newly created sets of multichannel images. MIND descriptors were used as feature images, and we chose total correlation as groupwise dissimilarity measure. Results show that groupwise multichannel image registration is a competitive alternative to the pairwise multichannel scheme, in terms of registration accuracy and insensitivity towards registration reference spaces."

Although various methods were developed for CT metal artifact reduction over the past decades, including the latest dual-domain deep networks, remaining metal artifacts are still clinically challenging in many cases. Here we extend the state-of-the-art dual-domain deep network approach into a quad-domain counterpart so that all the features in the sinogram, image, and their corresponding Fourier domains are synergized to eliminate metal artifacts optimally without compromising structural subtleties. Our proposed quad-domain network for MAR, referred to as Quad-Net, takes little additional computational cost since the Fourier transform is highly efficient, and works across the four receptive fields to learn both global and local features as well as their relations. Specifically, we first design a Sinogram-Fourier Restoration Network (SFR-Net) in the sinogram domain and its Fourier space to faithfully inpaint metal-corrupted traces. Then, we couple SFR-Net with an Image-Fourier Refinement Network (IFR-Net) which takes both an image and its Fourier spectrum to improve a CT image reconstructed from the SFR-Net output using cross-domain contextual information. Quad-Net is trained on clinical datasets to minimize a composite loss function. Quad-Net does not require precise metal masks, which is of great importance in clinical practice. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Quad-Net over the state-of-the-art MAR methods quantitatively, visually, and statistically.

With the development of computer science, computer aided diagnosis has been developed to process and analyze the retinal images automatically. One of the challenges in the analysis is that the quality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in human lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which reduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the retinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a combination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel structure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to restore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed SGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global edge-preserving smoothing. Our results show that the proposed SGRIF method is able to improve the contrast of retinal images, measured by histogram flatness measure, histogram spread, and variability of local luminosity. In addition, we further explored the benefits of SGRIF for subsequent retinal image processing and analyzing tasks. In the two applications of deep learning-based optic cup segmentation and sparse learning-based cup-to-disk ratio (CDR) computation, our results show that we are able to achieve more accurate optic cup segmentation and CDR measurements from images processed by SGRIF."

Consequently, we propose the use of the locally linear guided filter in combination with a learned guidance map for general purpose medical image processing. The output images are only processed by the guided filter while the guidance map can be trained to be task-optimal in an end-to-end fashion. We investigate the performance based on two popular tasks: image super resolution and denoising. The evaluation is conducted based on pairs of multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging and cross-modal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets. For both tasks, the proposed approach is on par with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we can show that the input image's content is almost unchanged after the processing which is not the case for conventional deep learning approaches.

Conventionally, image quality is evaluated using metrics to determine the contrast and resolution. These metrics require localization of specific regions and targets in the image such as a region of interest (ROI), a background region, and\/or a point scatterer. Such objects can all be difficult to identify in in-vivo images, especially for automatic evaluation of image quality in large amounts of data. Using a matrix array probe, we have recorded a Very Large cardiac Channel data Database (VLCD) to evaluate coherence as an in vivo image quality metric. The VLCD consists of 33280 individual image frames from 538 recordings of 106 patients. We also introduce a global image coherence (GIC), an in vivo image quality metric that does not require any identified ROI since it is defined as an average coherence value calculated from all the data pixels used to form the image, below a preselected range. The GIC is shown to be a quantitative metric for in vivo image quality when applied to the VLCD. We demonstrate, on a subset of the dataset, that the GIC correlates well with the conventional metrics contrast ratio (CR) and the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) with \n R \n = 0.74 (\n p<0.005 \n) and \n R \n = 0.62 (\n p<0.005 \n), respectively. There exist multiple methods to estimate the coherence of the received signal across the ultrasound array. We further show that all coherence measures investigated in this study are highly correlated (\n R> \n 0.9 and \n p<0.001 \n) when applied to the VLCD. Thus, even though there are differences in the implementation of coherence measures, all quantify the similarity of the signal across the array and can be averaged into a GIC to evaluate image quality automatically and quantitatively."

However, because of serious motion artifacts, CBCT-to-CT synthesis remains a challenging task for breast-cancer ART. Existing synthesis methods usually ignore motion artifacts, thereby limiting their performance on chest CBCT images. In this paper, we decompose CBCT-to-CT synthesis into artifact reduction and intensity correction, and we introduce breath-hold CBCT images to guide them. To achieve superior synthesis performance, we propose a multimodal unsupervised representation disentanglement (MURD) learning framework that disentangles the content, style, and artifact representations from CBCT and CT images in the latent space. MURD can synthesize different forms of images using the recombination of disentangled representations. Also, we propose a multipath consistency loss to improve structural consistency in synthesis and a multidomain generator to improve synthesis performance. Experiments on our breast-cancer dataset show that MURD achieves impressive performance with a mean absolute error of 55.23±9.94 HU, a structural similarity index measurement of 0.721±0.042, and a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 28.26±1.93 dB in synthetic CT.

(ii) A single registration network is trained in a one-shot manner, and then recurrently applied in inference for multiple times, such that the complex deformation field can be recovered incrementally. (iii) We also propose both the adaptive smoothing layer and the tissue-aware anti-folding constraint into the registration network to ensure the physiological plausibility of estimated deformations without degrading the registration accuracy. Experimental results, in comparison to the state-of-the-art registration methods, indicate that our proposed method achieves the highest registration accuracy while still preserving the smoothness of the deformation field.

  "abstrak": "A supervised framework is presented for the automatic registration and segmentation of white matter (WM) tractographies extracted from brain DT-MRI. The framework relies on the direct registration between the fibers, without requiring any intensity-based registration as preprocessing. An affine transform is recovered together with a set of segmented fibers. A recently introduced probabilistic boosting tree classifier is used in a segmentation refinement step to improve the precision of the target tract segmentation. The proposed method compares favorably with a state-of-the-art intensity-based algorithm for affine registration of DTI tractographies. Segmentation results for 12 major WM tracts are demonstrated. Quantitative results are also provided for the segmentation of a particularly difficult case, the optic radiation tract. An average precision of 80% and recall of 55% were obtained for the optimal configuration of the presented method."

  "judul": "MATR: Multimodal Medical Image Fusion via Multiscale Adaptive Transformer",
  "abstrak": "Owing to the limitations of imaging sensors, it is challenging to obtain a medical image that simultaneously contains functional metabolic information and structural tissue details. Multimodal medical image fusion, an effective way to merge the complementary information in different modalities, has become a significant technique to facilitate clinical diagnosis and surgical navigation. With powerful feature representation ability, deep learning (DL)-based methods have improved such fusion results but still have not achieved satisfactory performance. Specifically, existing DL-based methods generally depend on convolutional operations, which can well extract local patterns but have limited capability in preserving global context information. To compensate for this defect and achieve accurate fusion, we propose a novel unsupervised method to fuse multimodal medical images via a multiscale adaptive Transformer termed MATR. In the proposed method, instead of directly employing vanilla convolution, we introduce an adaptive convolution for adaptively modulating the convolutional kernel based on the global complementary context. To further model long-range dependencies, an adaptive Transformer is employed to enhance the global semantic extraction capability. Our network architecture is designed in a multiscale fashion so that useful multimodal information can be adequately acquired from the perspective of different scales. Moreover, an objective function composed of a structural loss and a region mutual information loss is devised to construct constraints for information preservation at both the structural-level and the feature-level. Extensive experiments on a mainstream database demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other representative and state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative evaluation. We also extend the proposed method to address other biomedical image fusion issues, and the pleasing fusion results illustrate that MATR has good generalization capability.

The proposed algorithm combines the well-known methodologies of ABS namely probabilistic atlas and atlas selection approaches into a single framework where two configurations are realized. The algorithm uses phase congruency maps to create an atlas which is robust to intensity variations. This allows an atlas derived from images acquired with one MR imaging sequence to be used to segment images acquired with a different MR imaging sequence and eliminates the need for intensity-based registration. Images acquired using a Dixon sequence were used to create an atlas which was used to segment both Dixon images (intra-sequence) and T1-weighted images (inter-sequence). In both cases, highly accurate results were achieved with the median Dice similarity coefficient values of 94% ±4% and 87±6.5%, respectively."

In this paper, 4-D vector flow imaging for intracardiac flow assessment is demonstrated using a clinical ultrasound (US) system and a matrix array transducer, without the use of contrast agent. Two acquisition schemes were developed, one for full volumetric coverage of the left ventricle (LA) at 50 vps and a 3-D thick-slice setup with continuous frame acquisition (4000 vps), both utilizing ECG-gating. The 3-D vector velocity estimates were obtained using a novel method combining phase and envelope information. In vitro validation in a rotating tissue-mimicking phantom revealed velocity estimates in compliance with the ground truth, with a linear regression slope of 0.80, 0.77, and 1.03 for the x, y, and z velocity components, and with standard deviations of 2.53, 3.19, and 0.95 cm\/s, respectively. In vivo measurements in a healthy LV showed good agreement with PC-MRI. Quantitative analysis of energy loss (EL) and kinetic energy (KE) further showed similar trends, with peak KE at 1.5 and 2.4 mJ during systole and 3.6 and 3.1 mJ for diastole for US and PC-MRI. Similar for EL, 0.15-0.2 and 0.7 mW was found during systole and 0.6 and 0.7 mW during diastole, for US and PC-MRI, respectively.

The starting representation is identical with that used in a very efficient coder for palette images, the piecewise-constant image model coding, but the techniques used for coding the elements of the representation are more advanced and especially suitable for the type of redundancy present in depth images. Initially, the vertical and horizontal crack-edges separating the constant depth regions are transmitted by 2D context coding using optimally pruned context trees. Both the encoder and decoder can reconstruct the regions of constant depth from the transmitted crack-edge image. The depth value in a given region is encoded using the depth values of the neighboring regions already encoded, exploiting the natural smoothness of the depth variation, and the mutual exclusiveness of the values in neighboring regions. The encoding method is suitable for lossless compression of depth images, obtaining compression of about 10-65 times, and additionally can be used as the entropy coding stage for lossy depth compression."

The proposed approach is based on alternating minimization (AM) of a new cost function with respect to the unknown high-resolution (HR) image and blurs. The regularization term for the HR image is based upon the Huber-Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a type of variational integral that exploits the piecewise smooth nature of the HR image. The blur estimation process is supported by an edge-emphasizing smoothing operation, which improves the quality of blur estimates by enhancing strong soft edges toward step edges, while filtering out weak structures. The parameters are updated gradually so that the number of salient edges used for blur estimation increases at each iteration. For better performance, the blur estimation is done in the filter domain rather than the pixel domain, i.e., using the gradients of the LR and HR images. The regularization term for the blur is Gaussian (L2 norm), which allows for fast noniterative optimization in the frequency domain. We accelerate the processing time of SR reconstruction by separating the upsampling and registration processes from the optimization procedure. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-life images (from a novel computational imager) confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

  "abstrak": "Real time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is rapidly gaining importance in interventional therapies. An accurate motion estimation is required for mobile targets and can be conveniently addressed using an image registration algorithm. Since the adaptation of the control parameters of the algorithm depends on the application (targeted organ, location of the tumor, slice orientation, etc.), typically an individual calibration is required. However, the assessment of the estimated motion accuracy is difficult since the real target motion is unknown. In this paper, existing criteria based only on anatomical image similarity are demonstrated to be inadequate. A new criterion is introduced, which is based on the local magnetic field distribution. The proposed criterion was used to assess, during a preparative calibration step, the optimal configuration of an image registration algorithm derived from the Horn and Schunck method. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated in a moving phantom experiment, which allows the comparison with the known motion pattern and to an established criterion based on anatomical images. The usefulness of the method for the calibration of optical-flow based algorithms was also demonstrated in vivo under conditions similar to thermo-ablation for the abdomen of twelve volunteers. In average over all volunteers, a resulting displacement error of 1.5 mm was obtained (largest observed error equal to 4-5 mm) using a criterion based on anatomical image similarity. A better average accuracy of 1 mm was achieved using the proposed criterion (largest observed error equal to 2 mm). In both kidney and liver, the proposed criterion was shown to provide motion field accuracy in the range of the best achievable."

This research describes expert interaction with a multiagent image interpretation system using only a restricted vocabulary of high-level user interactions. The aim is to minimize inter- and intra-observer variability by keeping the total number of interactions as low and simple as possible. The multiagent image interpretation system has elaborate high-level knowledge-based control over low-level image segmentation algorithms. Agents use contextual knowledge to keep the number of interactions low but, when in doubt, present the user with the most likely interpretation of the situation. The user, in turn, can correct, supplement, and\/or confirm the results of image-processing agents. This is done at a very high level of abstraction such that no knowledge of the underlying segmentation methods, parameters or agent functioning is needed. High-level interaction thereby replaces more traditional contour correction methods like inserting points and\/or (re)drawing contours. This makes it easier for the user to obtain good results, while inter- and intra-observer variability are kept minimal, since the image segmentation itself remains under control of image-processing agents. The system has been applied to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images. Experiments show that with an average of 2-3 high-level user interactions per correction, segmentation results substantially improve while the variation is greatly reduced. The achieved level of accuracy and repeatability is equivalent to that of manual drawing by an expert."

They typically transfer ground truth annotations from a label-rich imaging modality to a label-lacking imaging modality, under an assumption that different modalities share the same anatomical structure information. However, since these methods commonly use voxel\/pixel-wise cycle-consistency to regularize the mappings between modalities, high-level semantic information is not necessarily preserved. In this paper, we propose a novel anatomy-regularized representation learning approach for segmentation-oriented cross-modality image synthesis. It learns a common feature encoding across different modalities to form a shared latent space, where 1) the input and its synthesis present consistent anatomical structure information, and 2) the transformation between two images in one domain is preserved by their syntheses in another domain. We applied our method to the tasks of cross-modality skull segmentation and cardiac substructure segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art cross-modality medical image segmentation methods."

Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements."

For further evaluation of the algorithm, three real microarray images were also used, each containing 6400 spots. For the task of locating spot borders and surrounding background (BG) in each cell, an automatic gridding process was developed and applied on microarray images. The FGMM and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithms were applied to each cell with the purpose of discriminating foreground (FG) from BG. The segmentation abilities of both algorithms were evaluated by means of the segmentation matching factor, coefficient of determination, and concordance correlation, in respect to the actual classes (FG-BG pixels) of the simulated spots. Pairwise correlation and mean absolute error of the real images among replicates were also calculated. The FGMM was found to perform better and with equal processing time, as compared to the GMM, rendering the FGMM algorithm an efficient alternative for segmenting cDNA microarray images."

  "abstrak": "Due to peripheral nerve stimulation, the magnetic particle imaging (MPI) method is limited in the maximum applicable excitation-field amplitude. This in turn leads to a limitation of the size of the covered field of view (FoV) to few millimeters. In order to still capture a larger FoV, MPI is capable to rapidly acquire volumes in a multi-patch fashion. To this end, the small excitation volume is shifted through space using the magnetic focus fields. Recently, it has been shown that the individual patches are preferably reconstructed in a joint fashion by solving a single linear system of equations taking the coupling between individual patches into account. While this improves the image quality, it is computationally and memory demanding since the size of the linear system increases in the best case quadratically with the number of patches. In this paper, we will develop a reconstruction algorithm for MPI multi-patch data exploiting the sparsity of the joint system matrix. A highly efficient implicit matrix format allows for rapid on-the-fly calculations of linear algebra operations involving the system matrix. Using this approach, the computational effort can be reduced to a linear dependence on the number of used patches. The algorithm is validated on 3-D multi-patch phantom data sets and shown to reconstruct large data sets with 15 patches in less than 22 s."

However, severe banding artifacts appear in bSSFP imaging due to unbalanced gradients with nonzero 0 th moment applied by the conventional Wave-CAIPI technique. In this study, we propose a 3D Wave-bSSFP scheme that adopts truncated wave gradients with zero 0 th moment to avoid introducing additional banding artifacts and to maintain the advantages of wave encoding. The simulation results indicate that the number of wave cycles that are truncated and different options of applying wave gradients affect both the g-factor reduction and image quality, but the influence is limited. In phantom experiments, the proposed technique shows similar acceleration performance as the conventional Wave-CAIPI technique and effectively eliminates its introduced banding artifacts. Additionally, Wave-bSSFP obtains up to 12× retrospective acceleration at 0.8 mm isotropic resolution in in vivo 3D brain experiments and is superior to the state-of-the-art Controlled Aliasing In Parallel Imaging Results IN Higher Acceleration (CAIPIRINHA) technique, according to both visual validation and quantitative analysis.

Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and\/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient. It has a single tuning parameter that determines graph width, which can also be eliminated by the way of additional computation. MISTICA outperforms existing alignment methods when applied to microscopy image sequences of mouse arteries."

In this paper, we propose a reduced-complexity, one-pass, delayed-decision algorithm that systematically reduces the size of the search space, while also preserving its structure. In particular, we apply the proposed algorithm to two examples of adaptive context-based image processing systems, an image coding system that employs a context-based entropy coder, and a spatially adaptive image-denoising system. For these two types of widely used systems, we show that the proposed delayed-decision search algorithm outperforms instantaneous-decision algorithms with only a small increase in complexity. We also show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of other, higher complexity, delayed-decision algorithms."

This paper presents a new GPU based elastic image registration program named Ezys. The Ezys image registration algorithm belongs to the wide class of diffeomorphic demons but uses surface preserving image smoothing and regularization filters designed for a GPU that would be computationally expensive on a CPU. We describe the methods used in Ezys and present results from two important neuroscience applications. Firstly inter-subject registration for transfer of anatomical labels and secondly longitudinal intra-subject registration to quantify atrophy in individual subjects.

The detection and classification tasks are implemented by means of the state-of-the-art support vector machine approach. A quality check mechanism is integrated in order to reduce subsequent misreconstruction problems. The reconstruction is based on a linear regression method to compensate shadow regions by adjusting the intensities of the shaded pixels according to the statistical characteristics of the corresponding nonshadow regions. Moreover, borders are explicitly handled by making use of adaptive morphological filters and linear interpolation for the prevention of possible border artifacts in the reconstructed image. Experimental results obtained on three VHR images representing different shadow conditions are reported, discussed, and compared with two other reconstruction techniques."

The success of such a bi-modal imaging modality depends on accurate segmentation of the IVUS images and proper angular registration between these two modalities. This paper reports a novel IVUS segmentation methodology addressing this issue. The image preprocessing consisted of denoising, using the Wiener filter, followed by image smoothing, implemented through the application of the alternating sequential filter on the edge separability metric images. Extraction of the lumen\/intima and media\/adventitia boundaries was achieved by tracing the gray-scale peaks over the A-lines of the IVUS preprocessed images. Cubic spline interpolation, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal directions, ensured boundary smoothness and continuity. The detection of the guide-wire artifact in both modalities is used for angular registration. Intraluminal studies were conducted in 13 ex vivo segments of human coronaries. The IVUS segmentation accuracy was assessed against independent manual tracings, providing 91.82% sensitivity and 97.55% specificity.

Basically, the task of deformable image registration is to find the displacement field between the moving image and the fixed image. Many variational models are proposed for deformable image registration, under the assumption that the displacement field is continuous and smooth. However, displacement fields may be discontinuous, especially for medical images with intensity inhomogeneity, pathological tissues, or heavy noises. In the mathematical theory of elastoplasticity, when the displacement fields are possibly discontinuous, a suitable framework for describing the displacement fields is the space of functions of bounded deformation (BD). Inspired by this, we propose a novel deformable registration model, called the BD model, which allows discontinuities of displacement fields in images. The BD model is formulated in a variational framework by supposing the displacement field to be a function of BD. The existence of solutions of this model is proven. Numerical experiments on 2D images show that the BD model outperforms the classical demons model, the log-domain diffeomorphic demons model, and the state-of-the-art vectorial total variation model. Numerical experiments on two public 3D databases show that the target registration error of the BD model is competitive compared with more than ten other models."

The optimization problem can be solved effectively via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on MR images of both adult and pediatric subjects demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the details in the recovered high-resolution images, and outperforms methods such as the nearest-neighbor interpolation, cubic interpolation, iterative back projection (IBP), non-local means (NLM), and TV-based up-sampling."

Typical approaches to alleviate the digitization artifact can be divided into two categories: 1) careful selection of a set of pixels as close approximation to the unit disk and using numerical integration to determine the ORIM values, and 2) representing pixels using circular shapes such that they resemble that of the unit disk and then calculating ORIMs in polar space. These improvements still fall short of preserving the orthogonality of the ORIMs. In this paper, in contrast to the previous methods, we propose a different approach of using numerical optimization techniques to improve the orthogonality. We prove that with the improved orthogonality, image reconstruction becomes more accurate. Our simulation results also show that the optimized digital ORIMs can accurately reconstruct images and can represent subtle image details."

In this paper, we construct analysis and synthesis frames, formalizing BM3D image modeling, and use these frames to develop novel iterative deblurring algorithms. We consider two different formulations of the deblurring problem, i.e., one given by the minimization of the single-objective function and another based on the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) balance of two objective functions. The latter results in the algorithm where deblurring and denoising operations are decoupled. The convergence of the developed algorithms is proved. Simulation experiments show that the decoupled algorithm derived from the GNE formulation demonstrates the best numerical and visual results and shows superiority with respect to the state of the art in the field, confirming a valuable potential of BM3D-frames as an advanced image modeling tool."

  "abstrak": "Due to complex and volatile lighting environment, underwater imaging can be readily impaired by light scattering, warping, and noises. To improve the visual quality, Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) techniques have been widely studied. Recent efforts have also been contributed to evaluate and compare the UIE performances with subjective and objective methods. However, the subjective evaluation is time-consuming and uneconomic for all images, while existing objective methods have limited capabilities for the newly-developed UIE approaches based on deep learning. To fill this gap, we propose an Underwater Image Fidelity (UIF) metric for objective evaluation of enhanced underwater images. By exploiting the statistical features of these images in CIELab space, we present the naturalness, sharpness, and structure indexes. Among them, the naturalness and sharpness indexes represent the visual improvements of enhanced images; the structure index indicates the structural similarity between the underwater images before and after UIE. We combine all indexes with a saliency-based spatial pooling and thus obtain the final UIF metric. To evaluate the proposed metric, we also establish a first-of-its-kind large-scale UIE database with subjective scores, namely Underwater Image Enhancement Database (UIED). Experimental results confirm that the proposed UIF metric outperforms a variety of underwater and general-purpose image quality metrics. The database and source code are available at https:\/\/github.com\/z21110008\/UIF ."

  "abstrak": "Single traffic image deraining technology based on deep learning is a vital branch of image preprocessing, which is of great help to intelligent monitoring systems and driving navigation system. It is well understood that established deraining methods are derived based on one specific imaging model, neglecting the underlying correlations between different weather models and thereby limiting the applicability of these standard methods in real scenarios. To ameliorate this issue, in this work, we first explore the inherent relationship between a rain model and the haze one established up to date. We discover that these two models experience similar degradations in the low-frequency components (i.e., similarity) but diverse degradations in the high-frequency areas (i.e., diversity). Based on these observations, we develop a Similarity-Diversity model to describe these characteristics. Afterwards, we introduce a novel deep neural network to restore the rain-free background embedding the similarity-diversity model, namely deep similarity-diversity network (DSDNet). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate our proposed method that outperforms the other state of the art deraining techniques. On the other hand, we deploy the proposed algorithm with Google Vision API for object recognition, which also obtains satisfactory results both qualitatively and quantitatively."

  "judul": "A Framework for Hexagonal Image Processing Using Hexagonal Pixel-Perfect Approximations in Subpixel Resolution",
  "abstrak": "Image processing in hexagonal lattice has many advantages rather than square lattice. Researchers have addressed benefits of hexagonal structure in applications such as binarization, rotation, scaling and edge detection. Approximately all existing hardwares for capturing and displaying images are based on square lattice. Therefore, the best way for using advantages of hexagonal lattice is to find a proper software approach to convert square pixels to hexagonal ones. This paper presents a hexagonal platform based on interpolation which addresses three existing hexagonal challenges including imperfect hexagonal shape, inaccurate intensity level of hexagonal pixels and lower resolution in hexagonal space. The proposed interpolation is computed by overlaps between square and hexagonal pixels. Overlap types are formulated mathematically in 8 separate cases. Each overlap case is detected automatically and used to compute final gray-level intensity of hexagonal pixels. It is mathematically and experimentally shown that the proposed method satisfies necessary conditions for square-to-hexagonal conversion. The proposed scheme is evaluated on synthetic and real images with 10 different levels of noise in interpolation and edge detection applications. In synthetic images, the proposed method achieves the best figure of merit (FOM) 99.92% and 98.67% in high and low SNRs 100 and 20, respectively. Also, the proposed method outperforms existing state of the art hexagonal lattices with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 84.18% and mean rating 7.7 (out of 9) in real images."

Following a standard established procedure, a simulated microarray image of 1600 cells, each containing one spot, was produced. For further evaluation of the algorithm, three real microarray images were also used, each containing 6400 spots. For the task of locating spot borders and surrounding background (BG) in each cell, an automatic gridding process was developed and applied on microarray images. The FGMM and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithms were applied to each cell with the purpose of discriminating foreground (FG) from BG. The segmentation abilities of both algorithms were evaluated by means of the segmentation matching factor, coefficient of determination, and concordance correlation, in respect to the actual classes (FG-BG pixels) of the simulated spots. Pairwise correlation and mean absolute error of the real images among replicates were also calculated. The FGMM was found to perform better and with equal processing time, as compared to the GMM, rendering the FGMM algorithm an efficient alternative for segmenting cDNA microarray images."

Floating-point multiplications are performed to calculate the base-line in the target image, and other line coordinates are calculated using integer addition or subtraction and logical justifications from the base-line pixel coordinates in the target image. To avoid a heterogeneous distance between rotated pixels in the target image, each line rotates to two adjacent lines. The proposed method yields good performance in terms of speed and quality according to the results of an analysis of the computation speed and accuracy."

However, the traditional iterative power allocation algorithms are difficult to be implemented in reality because of their high computational complexity. With the development of machine learning algorithms, it has been proved that the machine learning method has excellent learning ability and low computational complexity, which can approximate the traditional iterative power allocation well and be easily to be implemented in reality. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network (DNN) model for DAS. From the perspective of machine learning, traditional iterative algorithms can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping between user channel realizations and optimal power allocation schemes. Therefore, we train the DNN to learn the nonlinear mapping between the user channel realizations and the corresponding power allocation schemes based on the traditional iterative algorithm. Then, a power allocation schemes based on DNN method is developed to maximize SE and EE for DAS. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only obtain the almost similar performance as the traditional iterative algorithm, but also reduce much online computational time."

  "abstrak": "In conventional networks, there was a tight bond between the control plane and the dataplane. The introduction of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separated these planes, and provided additional features and tools to solve some of the problems of traditional network (i.e., latency, consistency, efficiency). SDN is a flexible networking paradigm that boosts network control, programmability and automation. It proffers many benefits in many areas, including routing. More specifically, for efficiently organizing, managing and optimizing routing in networks, some intelligence is required, and SDN offers the possibility to easily integrate it. To this purpose, many researchers implemented different machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance SDN routing applications. This article surveys the use of ML techniques for routing optimization in SDN based on three core categories (i.e. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning). The main contributions of this survey are threefold. Firstly, it presents detailed summary tables related to these studies and their comparison is also discussed, including a summary of the best works according to our analysis. Secondly, it summarizes the main findings, best works and missing aspects, and it includes a quick guideline to choose the best ML technique in this field (based on available resources and objectives). Finally, it provides specific future research directions divided into six sections to conclude the survey. Our conclusion is that there is a huge trend to use intelligence-based routing in programmable networks, particularly during the last three years, but a lot of effort is still required to achieve comprehensive comparisons and synergies of approaches, meaningful evaluations based on open datasets and topologies, and detailed practical implementations (following recent standards) that could be adopted by industry. In summary, future efforts should be focused on reproducible research rather than on new isolated ideas. Otherwise, most of these applications will be barely implemented in practice."

The main problem in this process is how to analyze these BRs to discover all defects in the system, which is a tedious and time-consuming task if done manually because the number of BRs increases dramatically. Thus, the automated solution is the best. Most of the current research focuses on automating this process from different aspects, such as detecting the severity or priority of the bug. However, they did not consider the nature of the bug, which is a multi-class classification problem. This paper solves this problem by proposing a new prediction model to analyze BRs and predict the nature of the bug. The proposed model constructs an ensemble machine learning algorithm using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. We simulate the proposed model by using a publicly available dataset for two online software bug repositories (Mozilla and Eclipse), which includes six classes: Program Anomaly, GUI, Network or Security, Configuration, Performance, and Test-Code. The simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve better accuracy than most existing models, namely, 90.42% without text augmentation and 96.72% with text augmentation."

A major challenge in dementia is achieving accurate and timely diagnosis. In recent years, neuroimaging with computer-aided algorithms have made remarkable advances in addressing this challenge. The success of these approaches is mostly attributed to the application of machine learning techniques for neuroimaging. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of automated diagnostic approaches for dementia using medical image analysis and machine learning algorithms published in the recent years. Based on the rigorous review of the existing works, we have found that, while most of the studies focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent research has demonstrated reasonable performance in the identification of other types of dementia remains a major challenge. Multimodal imaging analysis deep learning approaches have shown promising results in the diagnosis of these other types of dementia.

Manual layout of such pathways or maps of knowledge is a difficult and time consuming process. Node duplication is a technique that makes layouts with improved readability possible by reducing edge crossings and shortening edge lengths in drawn diagrams. In this article, we propose an approach using Machine Learning (ML) to facilitate parts of this task by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with actions taken during manual biocuration. Our training input is a series of incremental snapshots of a diagram describing mechanisms of a disease, progressively curated by a human expert employing node duplication in the process. As a test of the trained SVM models, they are applied to a single large instance and 25 medium-sized instances of hand-curated biological pathways. Finally, in a user validation study, we compare the model predictions to the outcome of a node duplication questionnaire answered by users of biological pathways with varying experience. We successfully predicted nodes for duplication and emulated human choices, demonstrating that our approach can effectively learn human-like node duplication preferences to support curation of pathway diagrams in various contexts."

Generating proper DDI alerts during prescribing workflow has the potential to prevent DDIrelated adverse events. However, the implementation of DDI alerting system remains a challenge as users are experiencing alert overload which causes alert fatigue. One strategy to optimize the current system is to establish a list of high-priority DDIs for alerting purposes, though it is a resource-intensive task. In this study, we propose a machine learning framework to extract useful features from the FDA adverse event reports and then identify potential highpriority DDIs using an autoencoder-based semi-supervised learning algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using adverse event feature representations in differentiating highand low-priority DDIs. Additionally, the proposed algorithm utilizes stacked autoencoders and weighted support vector machine for boosting classification performance, which outperforms other competing methods in terms of F-measure and AUC score. This framework integrates multiple information sources, leverages domain knowledge and clinical evidence, and provides a practical approach for pre-screening high-priority DDI candidates for medication alerts."

Although researchers have shown significant interest in exploring Genetic Programming (GP) in AutoML for handling complex datasets, a critical issue that remains unresolved is the comprehensive understanding of GP hyper-parameters that influence machine learning performance. While GP-based AutoML excels in automating many aspects of the modelling, there has been a scarcity of research that provides insight into the significance of individual features and GP population size within the models of GP-based AutoML. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the models’ performance evaluation from multiple facets, including feature selection, GP population sizes, and different machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the association between Pearson correlations, machine learning performance, and the importance of machine learning features. The findings demonstrate that incorporating all the determinants as features in GP-based AutoML or relying solely on firm characteristics led to superior performance with an excellent trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate. Thus, higher accuracy results exceeding 0.9 of Area Under the Curve (AUC) are presented by the proposed models. The novelty of this study lies in its empirical evaluation of different approaches to GP-based AutoML implementation.

In general, accurate deep-learning classifiers provide little model interpretability, while interpretable models do not have competitive classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new deep-learning diagnosis framework, called InterNRL, that is designed to be highly accurate and interpretable. InterNRL consists of a student-teacher framework, where the student model is an interpretable prototype-based classifier (ProtoPNet) and the teacher is an accurate global image classifier (GlobalNet). The two classifiers are mutually optimised with a novel reciprocal learning paradigm in which the student ProtoPNet learns from optimal pseudo labels produced by the teacher GlobalNet, while GlobalNet learns from ProtoPNet’s classification performance and pseudo labels. This reciprocal learning paradigm enables InterNRL to be flexibly optimised under both fully- and semi-supervised learning scenarios, reaching state-of-the-art classification performance in both scenarios for the tasks of breast cancer and retinal disease diagnosis. Moreover, relying on weakly-labelled training images, InterNRL also achieves superior breast cancer localisation and brain tumour segmentation results than other competing methods."

Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D convolutional neural network and transfer learning. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task-dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse multi-task learning framework. In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised learning algorithm to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion approaches in computer vision, we propose to use proportion-support vector machine for characterizing tumors. We also seek the answer to the fundamental question about the goodness of “deep features” for unsupervised tumor classification.

Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. Selection of the best quality decoys is both challenging and essential as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter. We use different metrics to compare these scoring functions against three state-of-the-art scores. This is a first attempt at comparing different scoring functions using the same non-redundant dataset for training and testing and the same features. The results show that adding informative features may be more significant than the method used."

  "abstrak": "Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning (DL). Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide “obviously” interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward databased, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged."

  "abstrak": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a staple method for identifying certain health conditions in patients since its discovery. Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree\/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to."

  "abstrak": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) seeks to automatically find so-called machine learning pipelines that maximize the prediction performance when being used to train a model on a given dataset. One of the main and yet open challenges in AutoMLis an effective use of computational resources: An AutoML process involves the evaluation of many candidate pipelines, which are costly but often ineffective because they are canceled due to a timeout. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the runtime of two-step machine learning pipelines with up to one pre-processor, which can be used to anticipate whether or not a pipeline will time out. Separate runtime models are trained offline for each algorithm that may be used in a pipeline, and an overall prediction is derived from these models. We empirically show that the approach increases successful evaluations made by an AutoML tool while preserving or even improving on the previously best solutions."

  "abstrak": "Cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke are among the most common causes of death and disability worldwide and are preventable and treatable. Early detection of strokes and their rapid intervention play an important role in reducing the burden of disease and improving clinical outcomes. In recent years, machine learning methods have attracted a lot of attention as they can be used to detect strokes. The aim of this study is to identify reliable methods, algorithms, and features that help medical professionals make informed decisions about stroke treatment and prevention. To achieve this goal, we have developed an early stroke detection system based on CT images of the brain coupled with a genetic algorithm and a bidirectional long short-term Memory (BiLSTM) to detect strokes at a very early stage. For image classification, a genetic approach based on neural networks is used to select the most relevant features for classification. The BiLSTM model is then fed with these features. Cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic system, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), and AUC (Area Under The Curve). All of these metrics were used to determine the system’s overall effectiveness. The proposed diagnostic system achieved an accuracy of 96.5%. We also compared the performance of the proposed model with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. With the proposed diagnosis system, physicians can make an informed decision about stroke."

  "abstrak": "Clozapine is an anti-psychotic drug that is known to be effective in the treatment of patients with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS-SCZ), commonly estimated to be around one third of all cases. However, clinicians sometimes delay the initiation of this drug because of its adverse side-effects. Therefore, identification of predictive biological markers of clozapine response are extremely valuable to aid on-time initiation of treatment. In this study, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm based on pre-treatment electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets to predict response to clozapine treatment in 57 TRS-SCZs, where the treatment outcome, after at least one-year follow-up is determined using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). The ML algorithm has three steps: 1) a brain source localization (BSL) procedure using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach is employed on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from 30 specified brain regions. 2) An effective connectivity measure named symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is applied to the source waveforms. 3) A ML algorithm is applied to the STE matrix to determine whether a set of features can be found to discriminate most-responder (MR) SCZ patients from least-responder (LR) ones. The findings of this study reveal that STE features can achieve an accuracy of 95.83%. This finding implies that analysis of pre-treatment EEG could contribute to our ability to distinguish MR from LR SCZs, and that the source STE matrix may prove to be a promising tool for the prediction of the clinical response to clozapine."

  "abstrak": "Building a quantum analog of classical deep neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. A key issue is how to address the inherent nonlinearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum domain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum gates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is intrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in literature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of unitary transformations. In this article, we introduce the quantum path kernel (QPK), a formulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of deep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization performance in the classical domain, specifically, \nhierarchical feature learning\n. Our approach generalizes the notion of quantum neural tangent kernel, which has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine learning models. The QPK exploits the parameter trajectory, i.e., the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training, enabling the representation of differential layerwise convergence behaviors, or the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their manifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our approach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian \nxor\n mixtures: an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires multilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation."

  "abstrak": "Predicting the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has played an important role in many applications. Hence, a novel computational method for PPIs prediction is highly desirable. PPIs endow with protein amino acid mutation rate and two physicochemical properties of protein (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity). Deep polynomial network (DPN) is well-suited to integrate these modalities since it can represent any function on a finite sample dataset via the supervised deep learning algorithm. We propose a multimodal DPN (MDPN) algorithm to effectively integrate these modalities to enhance prediction performance. MDPN consists of a two-stage DPN, the first stage feeds multiple protein features into DPN encoding to obtain high-level feature representation while the second stage fuses and learns features by cascading three types of high-level features in the DPN encoding. We employ a regularized extreme learning machine to predict PPIs. The proposed method is tested on the public dataset of H. pylori, Human, and Yeast and achieves average accuracies of 97.87%, 99.90%, and 98.11%, respectively. The proposed method also achieves good accuracies on other datasets. Furthermore, we test our method on three kinds of PPI networks and obtain superior prediction results."

This approach may be effective for mutations with impact in the function of the protein, but ineffective for mutations in the translation initiation codon. Such mutation might avoid the generation of the protein. Consequently, specific methods for predicting the effect of mutations in the translation initiation codon are needed. We propose a method for predicting the effect of mutations in the canonical translation initiation codon based on a biological model that considers specific features of such mutations, like the distance to a potential alternative initiation codon. Our predictor has been developed using tree-based machine learning algorithms and dataextracted from Ensembl . Our final model is able to detect whether a mutation in the canonical initiation codon is deleterious or benign with a precision of 44.28% and an accuracy of 98.32%, which improves the results of state of the art tools such as PolyPhen , SIFT , or CADD for this type of mutation."

  "judul": "Extending the Tsetlin Machine With Integer-Weighted Clauses for Increased Interpretability",
  "abstrak": "Building models that are both interpretable and accurate is an unresolved challenge for many pattern recognition problems. In general, rule-based and linear models lack accuracy, while deep learning interpretability is based on rough approximations of the underlying inference. However, recently, the rule-based Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory footprint, and inference speed on diverse benchmarks (imageclassification, regression, natural language understanding, and game-playing). TMs construct rules using human-interpretable conjunctive clauses in propositional logic. These, in turn, are combined linearly to solve complex pattern recognition tasks. This paper addresses the accuracy-interpretability challenge in machine learning by introducing a TM with integer weighted clauses - the Integer Weighted TM (IWTM). The intent is to increase TM interpretability by reducing the number of clauses required for competitive performance. The IWTM achieves this by weighting the clauses so that a single clause can replace multiple duplicates. Since each TM clause is formed adaptively by a Tsetlin Automata (TA) team, identifying effective weights becomes a challenging online learning problem. We solve this problem by extending each team of TA with another kind of automaton: the stochastic searching on the line (SSL) automaton. We evaluate the performance of the new scheme empirically using five datasets, along with a study of interpretability. On average, IWTM uses 6.5 times fewer literals than the vanilla TM and 120 times fewer literals than a TM with real-valued weights. Furthermore, in terms of average memory usage and F1-Score, IWTM outperforms simple Multi-Layered Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost), Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), as well as the standard and real-value weighted TMs. IWTM finally outperforms Neural Additive Models on Fraud Detection and StructureBoost on CA-58 in terms of Area Under Curve, while performing competitively on COMPAS."

High mental stress may cause suicide ideations which are crucially driving suicide attempts.

This article utilizes machine learning techniques including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting regression tree, support vector machine and multilayer perceptron to predict the presence of suicide ideation by six important psychological stress domains of the military males and females. The accuracies of all the six machine learning methods are over 98%.

Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area."

With the development of machine learning algorithms, it has been proved that the machine learning method has excellent learning ability and low computational complexity, which can approximate the traditional iterative power allocation well and be easily to be implemented in reality. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network (DNN) model for DAS. From the perspective of machine learning, traditional iterative algorithms can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping between user channel realizations and optimal power allocation schemes. Therefore, we train the DNN to learn the nonlinear mapping between the user channel realizations and the corresponding power allocation schemes based on the traditional iterative algorithm. Then, a power allocation schemes based on DNN method is developed to maximize SE and EE for DAS. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only obtain the almost similar performance as the traditional iterative algorithm, but also reduce much online computational time."

According to a recent report, PCOS is diagnosed in 31.3% of women from Asia. Studies show that 69% to 70% of women did not avail of a detecting cure for PCOS. A research study is needed to save women from critical complications by identifying PCOS early. The main aim of our research is to predict PCOS using advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset based on clinical and physical parameters of women is utilized for building study models. A novel feature selection approach is proposed based on the optimized chi-squared (CS-PCOS) mechanism. The ten hyper-parametrized machine learning models are applied in comparison. Using the novel CS-PCOS approach, the gaussian naive bayes (GNB) outperformed machine learning models and state-of-the-art studies.

The individual prognosis after stroke is extremely dependent on treatment decisions physicians take during the acute phase. In the last five years, several scores such as the ASTRAL, DRAGON, and THRIVE have been proposed as tools to help physicians predict the patient functional outcome after a stroke. These scores are rule-based classifiers that use features available when the patient is admitted to the emergency room. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to the problem of predicting the functional outcome of ischemic stroke patients, three months after admission. We show that a pure machine learning approach achieves only a marginally superior Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) ( 0.808±0.085 ) than that of the best score ( 0.771±0.056 ) when using the features available at admission. However, we observed that by progressively adding features available at further points in time, we can significantly increase the AUC to a value above 0.90. We conclude that the results obtained validate the use of the scores at the time of admission, but also point to the importance of using more features, which require more advanced methods, when possible."

  "abstrak": "Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that is characterized by imprecise comprehension of words and generally poor reading performance. It affects a significant population of school-age children, with more occurrences in males, thus, putting them at risk of poor academic performance and low self-esteem for a lifetime. The long-term hope is to have a dyslexia diagnostic method that is informed by neural-biomarkers. In this regard, large numbers of machine learning methods and, more recently, deep learning methods have been implemented across various types of dataset with the above-chance classification accuracy. However, attainment of clinical acceptability of these state-of-the-art methods is bedeviled by certain challenges including lack of biologically-interpretable biomarkers, privacy of dataset and classifiers, hyper-parameter selection\/optimization, and overfitting problem among others. This review paper critically analyzes recent machine learning methods for detecting dyslexia and its biomarkers and discusses challenges that require proper attentions from the users of deep learning methods in order to enable them to attain clinically relevance and acceptable level. The review is conducted within the premise of implementation and experimental outcomes for each of the 22 selected articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, with a view to outlining some critical challenges for achieving high accuracy and reliability of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. As an evidence-based protocol for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, PRISMA helps to ensure clarity and transparency of this paper by showing a four-phase flow diagram of the selection process for articles used in this review. It is therefore, envisaged that higher classification performance of clinical relevance can be achieved using deep learning models for dyslexia and its biomarkers by addressing identified potential challeng..."

  "judul": "A Review on Arabic Sentiment Analysis: State-of-the-Art, Taxonomy and Open Research Challenges",
  "abstrak": "Due to the significant use of Arabic language in social media networks, the demand for Arabic sentiment analysis has increased rapidly. Although, numerous sentiment analysis techniques enable people to obtain valuable insights from the opinions shared on social media. However, these techniques are still in their infancy, and the Arabic sentiment analysis domain lacks a compressive survey. Therefore, this study focused on the various characteristics, State-of-the-Art, and the level of sentiment analysis along with the natural language processing applied in the Arabic sentiment analysis. Furthermore, this study also discussed the sentiment analysis of the modern standards and the dialects of Arabic languages along with various machine learning processes and a few popular algorithms. Moreover, this study adds values by critical analysis of two case studies, which displayed an extensive set of the various research communities in this field of sentiment analysis. Finally, open research challenges are investigated, with a focus on the shortage of lexicons; availability; use of Dialect Arabic (DA); lack of corpora and datasets; right to left reading and compound phrases and idioms."

  "abstrak": "A model's interpretability is essential to many practical applications such as clinical decision support systems. In this article, a novel interpretable machine learning method is presented, which can model the relationship between input variables and responses in humanly understandable rules.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of ransomware, its taxonomy, and its state-of-the-art research contributions. We begin by tracing the origins of ransomware and its evolution over time, highlighting the key milestones and major trends. Next, we propose a taxonomy of ransomware that categorizes different types of ransomware based on their characteristics and behavior. Subsequently, we review the existing research over several years in regard to detection, prevention, mitigation, and prediction techniques. Our extensive analysis, based on more than 150 references, has revealed that significant research, specifically 72.8%, has focused on detecting ransomware. However, a lack of emphasis has been placed on predicting ransomware. Additionally, of the studies focused on ransomware detection, a significant portion, 70%, have utilized Machine Learning methods. This study uncovers a range of shortcomings in research pertaining to real-time protection and identifying zero-day ransomware, and two issues specific to Machine Learning models. Adversarial machine learning exploitation and concept drift have been identified as under-researched areas in the field. This survey is a constructive roadmap for researchers interested in ransomware research matters."

  "abstrak": "Machine learning algorithms are widely utilized in cybersecurity. However, recent studies show that machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This poses new threats to the security-critical applications in cybersecurity. Currently, there is still a short of study on adversarial examples in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose a new method known as the brute-force attack method to better evaluate the robustness of the machine learning classifiers in cybersecurity against adversarial examples. The proposed method, which works in a black-box way and covers some shortages of the existing adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, is simple to implement and only needs the output of the target classifiers to generate adversarial examples. To have a comprehensive evaluation of the attack performance of the proposed method, we use our method to generate adversarial examples against the common machine learning based security systems in cybersecurity including host intrusion detection systems, Android malware detection systems, and network intrusion detection systems. We compare the attack performance of the proposed method against these security systems with that of state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods based on generative adversarial networks. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method, which is more efficient in computation and outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods based on generative adversarial networks, can be used to evaluate the robustness of various machine learning based systems in cybersecurity against adversarial examples."

The combination of machine vision and robotics to achieve the same precise and fast grasping as that of humans requires high-precision target detection and recognition, location and reasonable grasp strategy generation, which is the ultimate goal of global researchers and one of the prerequisites for the large-scale application of robots. Traditional machine learning has a long history and good achievements in the field of image processing and robot control. The CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithm realizes training of large-scale image datasets, solves the disadvantages of traditional machine learning in large datasets, and greatly improves accuracy, thereby positioning CNNs as a global research hotspot. However, the increasing difficulty of labeled data acquisition limits their development. Therefore, unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning, which are less dependent on labeled data, have also undergone rapid development and achieved good performance in the fields of image processing and robot capture. According to the inherent defects of vision, this paper summarizes the research achievements of tactile feedback in the fields of target recognition and robot grasping and finds that the combination of vision and tactile feedback can improve the success rate and robustness of robot grasping. This paper provides a systematic summary and analysis of the research status of machine vision and tactile feedback in the field of robot grasping and establishes a reasonable reference for future research."

  "abstrak": "Agriculture contributes a significant amount to the economy of India due to the dependence on human beings for their survival. The main obstacle to food security is population expansion leading to rising demand for food. Farmers must produce more on the same land to boost the supply. Through crop yield prediction, technology can assist farmers in producing more. This paper’s primary goal is to predict crop yield utilizing the variables of rainfall, crop, meteorological conditions, area, production, and yield that have posed a serious threat to the long-term viability of agriculture. Crop yield prediction is a decision-support tool that uses machine learning and deep learning that can be used to make decisions about which crops to produce and what to do in the crop’s growing season. It can decide which crops to produce and what to do in the crop’s growing season. Regardless of the distracting environment, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are utilized in crop selection to reduce agricultural yield output losses. To estimate the agricultural yield, machine learning techniques: decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost regression; deep learning techniques - convolutional neural network and long-short term memory network have been used. Accuracy, root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, standard deviation, and losses are compared. Other machine learning and deep learning methods fall short compared to the random forest and convolutional neural network. The random forest has a maximum accuracy of 98.96%, mean absolute error of 1.97, root mean square error of 2.45, and standard deviation of 1.23. The convolutional neural network has been evaluated with a minimum loss of 0.00060. Consequently, a model is developed that, compared to other algorithms, predicts the yield quite well. The findings are then analyzed using the root mean square error metric to understand better how the model’s errors compare to those of the other methods."

One of the main and yet open challenges in AutoMLis an effective use of computational resources: An AutoML process involves the evaluation of many candidate pipelines, which are costly but often ineffective because they are canceled due to a timeout. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the runtime of two-step machine learning pipelines with up to one pre-processor, which can be used to anticipate whether or not a pipeline will time out. Separate runtime models are trained offline for each algorithm that may be used in a pipeline, and an overall prediction is derived from these models. We empirically show that the approach increases successful evaluations made by an AutoML tool while preserving or even improving on the previously best solutions."

We are motivated by the relaxation-time limit from the quantum-Navier-Stokes-Poisson system (QNSP) to the QDD equation and the existence of finite energy weak solutions to the QDD equation has been proved. Therefore, in this work, the quantum drift-diffusion learning neural network (QDDLNN) is proposed to investigate the quantum drift phenomena from limited observations.

In the identification, supervised machine learning is often used, but it requires exorbitant efforts to maintain and label the LOS and NLOS database. In this paper, we apply unsupervised machine learning approach called “expectation maximization for Gaussian mixture models” to classify LOS and NLOS components. The key advantage of applying unsupervised machine learning is that it does not require any rigorous and explicit labeling of the database at a certain location. The simulation results demonstrate that by using the proposed algorithm, LOS and NLOS signals can be classified with 86.50% correct rate, 12.70% false negative, and 0.8% false positive rate. We also compare the proposed algorithm with the existing cutting-edge supervised machine learning algorithms in terms of computational complexity and signals' classification performance."

  "abstrak": "With the popularization of machine learning (ML) techniques and the increased chipset's performance, the application of ML to pedestrian localization systems has received significant attention in the last years. Several survey papers have attempted to provide a state-of-the-art overview, but they usually limit their scope to a particular type of positioning system or technology. In addition, they are written from the point of view of ML techniques and their practice, not from the point of view of the localization system and the specific problems that ML techniques can help to solve. This article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey of the ML techniques that have been adopted over the last ten years to improve the performance of pedestrian localization systems, addressing the applicability of ML techniques in this domain, along with the main localization strategies. It concludes by indicating the underlying open issues and challenges associated with the existing systems, and possible future directions in which ML techniques could improve the performance of pedestrian localization systems. Among other open issues, most previous authors have focused their attention on position estimation accuracy, which wastes the potential of ML techniques to improve other performance parameters (e.g., response time, computational complexity, robustness, scalability or energy efficiency). This study shows that there is a strong trend towards the application of supervised learning. Consequently, there are many potential research opportunities in the use of other learning types, such as unsupervised and reinforcement learning, to improve the performance of pedestrian localization systems."

  "judul": "Resonant Machine Learning Based on Complex Growth Transform Dynamical Systems",
  "abstrak": "Traditional energy-based learning models associate a single energy metric to each configuration of variables involved in the underlying optimization process. Such models associate the lowest energy state with the optimal configuration of variables under consideration and are thus inherently dissipative. In this article, we propose an energy-efficient learning framework that exploits structural and functional similarities between a machine-learning network and a general electrical network satisfying Tellegen's theorem. In contrast to the standard energy-based models, the proposed formulation associates two energy components, namely, active and reactive energy with the network. The formulation ensures that the network's active power is dissipated only during the process of learning, whereas the reactive power is maintained to be zero at all times. As a result, in steady state, the learned parameters are stored and self-sustained by electrical resonance determined by the network's nodal inductances and capacitances. Based on this approach, this article introduces three novel concepts: 1) a learning framework where the network's active-power dissipation is used as a regularization for a learning objective function that is subjected to zero total reactive-power constraint; 2) a dynamical system based on complex-domain, continuous-time growth transforms that optimizes the learning objective function and drives the network toward electrical resonance under steady-state operation; and 3) an annealing procedure that controls the tradeoff between active-power dissipation and the speed of convergence. As a representative example, we show how the proposed framework can be used for designing resonant support vector machines (SVMs), where the support vectors correspond to an LC network with self-sustained oscillations. We also show that this resonant network dissipates less active power compared with its non-resonant counterpart."

  "abstrak": "Despite a rise in the use of functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study neural systems, fNIRS signal processing is not standardized and is highly affected by empirical and manual procedures. At the beginning of any signal processing procedure, Signal Quality Control (SQC) is critical to prevent errors and unreliable results. In fNIRS analysis, SQC currently relies on applying empirical thresholds to handcrafted Signal Quality Indicators (SQIs). In this study, we use a dataset of fNIRS signals (N = 1,340) recorded from 67 subjects, and manually label the signal quality of a subset of segments (N = 548) to investigate the pitfalls of current practices while exploring the opportunities provided by Deep Learning approaches. We show that SQIs statistically discriminate signals with bad quality, but the identification by means of empirical thresholds lacks sensitivity. Alternatively to manual thresholding, conventional machine learning models based on the SQIs have been proven more accurate, with end-to-end approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of further improving the performance. The proposed approach, based on machine learning, represents a more objective SQC for fNIRS and moves towards the use of fully automated and standardized procedures."

  "abstrak": "Multi-task learning technique is widely utilized in machine learning modeling where commonalities and differences across multiple tasks are exploited. However, multiple conflicting objectives often occur in multi-task learning. Conventionally, a common compromise is to minimize the weighted sum of multiple objectives which may be invalid if the objectives are competing. In this paper, a novel multi-objective machine learning approach is proposed to solve this challenging issue, which reformulates the multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization. To address the issues contributed by existing multi-objective optimization algorithms, a multi-gradient descent algorithm is introduced for the multi-objective machine learning problem by which an innovative gradient-based optimization is leveraged to converge to an optimal solution of the Pareto set. Moreover, the gradient surgery for the multi-gradient descent algorithm is proposed to obtain a stable Pareto optimal solution. As most of the edge computing devices are computational resource-constrained, the proposed method is implemented for optimizing the edge device's memory, computation and communication demands. The proposed method is applied to the multiple license plate recognition problem. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods and can successfully find solutions that balance multiple objectives of the learning task over different datasets."

When considering large populations, this becomes a time-consuming process, that can be limited by inter-observer variability and operator bias. In this study, we developed and optimized an automated ZC selection algorithm, towards a faster more robust isochrone generation approach. The algorithm either relies on heuristic-based baselines or machine learning classifiers. Manually generated isochrones, previously validated against 3D intracardiac mapping, were considered as ground truth during training and performance evaluation steps. The machine learning models applied herein for the first time were: i) logistic regression; ii) support vector machine (SVM); and iii) Random Forest. The SVM and Random Forest classifiers successfully identified accessory pathways in Wolff-Parkinson-White patients, characterized sinus rhythm in humans, and localized the pacing electrode location in left ventricular paced canines on the resulting isochrones. Nevertheless, the best performing classifier was proven to be Random Forest with a precision rising from 89.5% to 97%, obtained with the voting approach that sets a probability threshold upon ZC candidate selection. Furthermore, the predictivity was not dependent on the type of testing dataset it was applied to, contrary to SVM that exhibited a 5% drop in precision on the canine testing dataset. Finally, these findings indicate that a machine learning approach can reduce user variability and considerably decrease the durations required for isochrone generation, while preserving accurate activation patterns."

However, because neural networks with manually designed features are commonly used to deal with continuous state and action spaces, the generalization capability and learning efficiency of previous ACDs still need to be improved. In this paper, a novel framework of ACDs with sparse kernel machines is presented by integrating kernel methods into the critic of ACDs. To improve the generalization capability as well as the computational efficiency of kernel machines, a sparsification method based on the approximately linear dependence analysis is used. Using the sparse kernel machines, two kernel-based ACD algorithms, that is, kernel HDP (KHDP) and kernel DHP (KDHP), are proposed and their performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because of the representation learning and generalization capability of sparse kernel machines, KHDP and KDHP can obtain much better performance than previous HDP and DHP with manually designed neural networks. Simulation and experimental results of two nonlinear control problems, that is, a continuous-action inverted pendulum problem and a ball and plate control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel ACD methods."

Towards this end, high-throughput techniques for cell mechanical phenotyping have been proposed to get a multidimensional biophysical characterization of single cells.

We focused on this problem, since the characterization of reticulocytes (their percentage and cellular features) in the blood is vital in multiple human disease conditions, especially bone-marrow disorders such as anemia and leukemia. Our approach reports promising label-free results in the classification of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells, and it represents a step forward in the development of high-throughput morpho-rheological-based methodologies for the computational categorization of single cells.

  "abstrak": "Analyzing the effective factors influencing online learning performance is a research topic that has garnered significant attention. Traditional approaches, such as multiple regression and structural equation models, tend to assume linearity, while non-linear machine learning models lack interpretability. To address this gap, we propose a framework that interprets machine learning models to analyze the effective factors of online learning performance. By applying this framework to four benchmark datasets of online learning, we examine the differential impact of various factors on performance, explore the interactions among these factors, and identify the key factors for representative learners. Our findings indicate that: 1) non-linear machine learning models, particularly Decision Regression, offer better representation of the non-linear relationship between effective factors and online learning performance compared to classical multivariate regression; 2) the factor of online learning behavior exerts a greater influence on performance than demographic features, academic background, or online curriculum design; 3) online learning behavior features exhibit additional interaction effects on performance; and 4) learners with medium performance are influenced by diverse effective factors, with active participation in online learning activities emerging as the most crucial means to improve performance. Interpreting machine learning models presents an innovative approach for analyzing the effective factors of online learning performance, which can be extended to other factor analysis studies. The results of this research provide valuable insights for optimizing machine learning models in predicting online learning performance and enhancing learner outcomes."

Five devices, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, were attached to the waist, wrists and ankles of eight younger adults. The system was experimented within three aspects: machine learning models, sensor placement, and sampling frequencies, to which the non-causal six-stages temporal convolutional network using 6.25 Hz signals from the left wrist and right ankle obtained the optimal performance. The duration prediction error ranged from 0.63±0.29 s ( turning 360° ) to 8.21±16.41 s ( walking ). The results suggest the potential for the proposed system in the automatic recognition and segmentation of mPPT items. Future work includes improving the recognition performance of lifting a book and implementing the frailty score prediction."

  "judul": "A Machine Learning Based Framework for Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks",
  "abstrak": "In complex networks, identifying influential nodes is of great importance for its wide applications. Traditional centrality methods are usually directly based on topological structures of networks, and different centrality methods consider different structural characteristics related to the functional importance. However, in many scenarios, it always exists a complex and nonlinear relationship between the functional importance of a node and its various features including local location, global location, etc., which is hard to be described by one centrality. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework based on machine learning to measure the importance of nodes in the propagation scenario. This framework first constructs the feature vector of each node based on the existing centrality methods which can reflect nodes' different topological structures and the infection rate which is an important factor in the propagation scenarios, then labels each node based on the real propagation ability obtained from simulated propagation experiments based on SIR model, last uses seven machine learning algorithms to learn the complex relationship between the real propagation ability of each node and its various structural features. The experimental results in real-world networks show that the classification accuracy of the model based on machine learning is generally higher than that of the traditional centrality methods based on one certain topology."

The application domain of this work is focused on addressing the inherent security vulnerabilities of SDN environments and developing an automated system for detecting and mitigating network attacks. The problem focused on in this review is the need for effective defensive mechanisms and detection methodologies to address these vulnerabilities. Conventional network measurement methodologies are limited in the context of SDNs, and the proposed ML and DL techniques aim to overcome these limitations by providing more accurate and efficient detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of related works in the field of SDN anomaly detection recent advances, categorized into two groups via ML and DL techniques. The proposed systems utilize a variety of techniques, including Supervised Learning (SL), Unsupervised Learning (UL) Ensemble Learning (EL) and DL solutions, to process IP flows, profile network traffic, and identify attacks. The output comprises the mitigation policies learned by ML\/DL techniques, and the proposed systems act as sophisticated gatekeepers, applying automated mitigation policies to curtail the extent of damage resulting from these attacks. The results obtained from the evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, confirm the marked effectiveness of the proposed systems in detecting and mitigating various types of attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The proposed systems’ foundational contributions are manifest in their efficacy for both DDoS attack detection and defense within the SDN environment.

  "abstrak": "Advanced machine learning techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to increase the accuracy of board-level functional fault diagnosis and reduce product cost through successful repair. Ambiguous or incorrect diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair cost. We propose a smart diagnosis method based on multikernel support vector machines (MK-SVMs) and incremental learning. The MK-SVM method leverages a linear combination of single kernels to achieve accurate faulty-component classification based on the errors observed. The MK-SVMs thus generated can also be updated based on incremental learning, which allows the diagnosis system to quickly adapt to new error observations and provide even more accurate fault diagnosis. Two complex boards from industry, currently in volume production, are used to validate the proposed diagnosis approach in terms of diagnosis accuracy (success rate) and quantifiable improvements over previously proposed machine-learning methods based on several single-kernel SVMs and artificial neural networks."

Crop yield predictions are carried out to estimate higher crop yield through the use of machine learning algorithms which are one of the challenging issues in the agricultural sector. Due to this developing significance of crop yield prediction, this article provides an exhaustive review on the use of machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield with special emphasis on palm oil yield prediction. Initially, the current status of palm oil yield around the world is presented, along with a brief discussion on the overview of widely used features and prediction algorithms.

Consequently, a detailed study of the advantages and difficulties related to machine learning-based crop yield prediction and proper identification of current and future challenges to the agricultural industry is presented. The potential solutions are additionally prescribed in order to alleviate existing problems in crop yield prediction. Since one of the major objectives of this study is to explore the future perspectives of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction, the areas including application of remote sensing, plant's growth and disease recognition, mapping and tree counting, optimum features and algorithms have been broadly discussed. Finally, a prospective architecture of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction has been proposed based on the critical evaluation of existing related studies. This technology will fulfill its promise by performing new research challenges in the analysis of crop yield prediction and the development of an extremely effective model for the prediction of palm oil yields with the most minimal computational difficulty."

  "abstrak": "Cloud network monitoring data is dynamic and distributed. Signals to monitor the cloud can appear, disappear or change their importance and clarity over time. Machine learning (ML) models tuned to a given data set can therefore quickly become inadequate. A model might be highly accurate at one point in time but may lose its accuracy at a later time due to changes in input data and their features. Distributed learning with dynamic model selection is therefore often required. Under such selection, poorly performing models (although aggressively tuned for the prior data) are retired or put on standby while new or standby models are brought in. The well-known method of Ensemble ML (EML) may potentially be applied to improve the overall accuracy of a family of ML models. Unfortunately, EML has several disadvantages, including the need for continuous training, excessive computational resources, requirement for large training datasets, high risks of overfitting, and a time-consuming model-building process. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud methodology for automatic ML model selection and tuning that automates model building and selection and is competitive with existing methods. We use unsupervised learning to better explore the data space before the generation of targeted supervised learning models in an automated fashion. In particular, we create a Cloud DevOps architecture for autotuning and selection based on container orchestration and messaging between containers, and take advantage of a new autoscaling method to dynamically create and evaluate instantiations of ML algorithms. The proposed methodology and tool are demonstrated on cloud network security datasets."

Given the numerous sell-side recommendations for a single stock, making unbiased investment decisions is not often straightforward for portfolio managers. This study explores the use of historical sell-side recommendations to create an unbiased fusion of analyst forecasts such that bidirectional accuracy is optimised using random forest, extreme gradient boosting, deep neural networks, and logistic regression. We introduced 12-month rolling features generated from standard sell-side recommendations, such as analyst coverage, point and directional accuracy, while avoiding forward-looking biases. We introduce a novel “AI analyst” by fusing forecast features from numerous analysts using machine learning algorithms. We observed the added benefits of using these features from more than one analyst by systematically generating unbiased and incrementally better prediction accuracy from publicly available sell-side recommendations, with the Random forest algorithm showing the highest relative performance. In highly volatile sectors, like resources, the machine learning algorithms perform better than in low volatility sectors, suggesting the importance of rolling features in bi-directional prediction in the presence of high volatility. Using feature importance, we observe the incremental contribution of rolling features, showing the relationships between analyst coverage, volatility, and bidirectional forecast accuracy. Furthermore, parameters from logistic regression identify volatility features and initial and target price as some of the essential features when modelling analysts’ directional predictions."

  "judul": "A Novel Machine Learning Approach for Android Malware Detection Based on the Co-Existence of Features",
  "abstrak": "This paper proposes a machine learning model based on the co-existence of static features for Android malware detection. The proposed model assumes that Android malware requests an abnormal set of co-existed permissions and APIs in comparing to those requested by benign applications. To prove this assumption, the paper created a new dataset of co-existed permissions and API calls at different levels of combinations, which are the second level, the third level, the fourth level and the fifth level. The extracted datasets of co-existed features at different levels were applied on permissions only, APIs only, permissions and APIs, and APIs and APIs frequencies. To extract the most relevant co-existed features, the frequent pattern growth (FP-growth) algorithm, which is an association rule mining technique, was used. The new datasets were extracted using Android APK samples from the Drebin, Malgenome and MalDroid2020 datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, several conventional machine learning algorithms were used. The results show that the model can successfully classify Android malware with a high accuracy using machine learning algorithms and the co-existence of features. Moreover, the results show that the achieved classification accuracy depends on the classifier and the type of co-existed features. The maximum accuracy, which is 98%, was achieved using the Random Forest algorithm and the co-existence of permissions features at the second combination level. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model. Using Malgenome dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of about 98%, while the state-of-the-art achieved an accuracy of about 87%. In addition, the experiments show that using the Drebin dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of about 95%, while the state-of-the-art achieved an accuracy of about 93%."

Since manual grading is time-consuming, costly, and requires a substantial amount of labor. This study introduces a novel approach for tomato quality sorting and grading. The method leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and traditional machine-learning algorithms for classification (hybrid model). The single-board computer NVIDIA Jetson TX1 was used to create a tomato image dataset. Image preprocessing and fine-tuning techniques were applied to enable deep layers to learn and concentrate on complex and significant features. The extracted features were then classified using traditional machine learning algorithms namely: support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Among the proposed hybrid models, the CNN-SVM method has outperformed other hybrid approaches, attaining an accuracy of 97.50% in the binary classification of tomatoes as healthy or rejected and 96.67% in the multiclass classification of them as ripe, unripe, or rejected when Inceptionv3 was used as feature extractor. Once another dataset (public dataset) was used, the proposed hybrid model CNN-SVM achieved an accuracy of 97.54% in categorizing tomatoes as ripe, unripe, old, or damaged outperforming other hybrid models when Inceptionv3 was used as a feature extractor. The performance metrics accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, and F1-score of the best-performing proposed hybrid model were evaluated."

However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition."

In order to improve their robustness and performance in less than optimal signal environments, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based GNSS models (ML models) as early as the 1990s. However, no study has been done in a systematic way to analyze the extent of the research on the utilization of ML models in GNSS and their performance. In this study, we perform a systematic review of studies from 2000 to 2021 in the literature that utilizes machine learning techniques in GNSS use cases. We assess the performance of the machine learning techniques in the existing literature on their application to GNSS. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. In this paper, we have identified 213 selected studies and ten categories of machine learning techniques. The results prove the acceptable performance of machine learning techniques in several GNSS use cases. In most cases, the models using the machine learning techniques in these GNSS use cases outperform the traditional GNSS models. ML models are promising in their utilization in GNSS. However, the application of ML models in the industry is still limited. More effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the utilization of ML models in the PNT context. Therefore, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers and guidelines for practitioners."

A prospective pilot study was conducted with 33 participants admitted to a long-term care facility between August 10 and 25, 2020. During the pilot study, we collected 560 cases that included 33 clinical variables and the survey items from the short confusion assessment method (S-CAM), and developed a mobile-based application. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including four rule-mining algorithms (C4.5, CBA, MCAR, and LEM2) and four other statistical learning algorithms (LR, ANNs, SVMs with three kernel functions, and random forest), were validated by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on both macro-averaged F1 and weighted average F1-measures during the 10-times stratified 2-fold cross-validation. The LEM2 algorithm achieved the best prediction performance (macro-averaged F1-measure of 49.35%; weighted average F1-measure of 96.55%), correctly identifying adult patients at delirium risk. In the pairwise comparison between predictive powers observed from independent models, the LEM2 model showed a medium or large effect size between 0.4925 and 0.8766 when compared with LR, ANN, SVM with RBF, and MCAR models. We have confirmed that acute consciousness in S-CAM assessment is closely associated with different predictors for screening three psychomotor behaviors of delirium: 1) education level, dementia type or its level, sleep disorder, dehydration, and infection in mixed-type delirium; 2) gender, education level, dementia type, dehydration, bedsores, and foley catheter in hyperactive delirium; and 3) pain, sleep disorder, and haloperidol use in hypoactive delirium."

We propose a generic algorithmic framework, which leverages two classic representation learning paradigms, i.e., sparse representation and the trace quotient criterion, to disentangle underlying factors of variation in high dimensional images. Specifically, we aim to learn simple representations of low dimensional, discriminant factors by applying the trace quotient criterion to well-engineered sparse representations. We construct a unified cost function, coined as the SPARse LOW dimensional representation (SparLow) function, for jointly learning both a sparsifying dictionary and a dimensionality reduction transformation. The SparLow function is widely applicable for developing various algorithms in three classic machine learning scenarios, namely, unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning. In order to develop efficient joint learning algorithms for maximizing the SparLow function, we deploy a framework of sparse coding with appropriate convex priors to ensure the sparse representations to be locally differentiable. Moreover, we develop an efficient geometric conjugate gradient algorithm to maximize the SparLow function on its underlying Riemannian manifold. Performance of the proposed SparLow algorithmic framework is investigated on several image processing tasks, such as 3D data visualization, face\/digit recognition, and object\/scene categorization."

Attacks that cause misclassifications or mispredictions can lead to erroneous decisions resulting in unreliable operations. Designing robust ML with the ability to provide reliable results in the presence of such attacks has become a top priority in the field of adversarial machine learning. An essential characteristic for rapid development of robust ML is an arms race between attack and defense strategists. However, an important prerequisite for the arms race is access to a well-defined system model so that experiments can be repeated by independent researchers. This article proposes a fine-grained system-driven taxonomy to specify ML applications and adversarial system models in an unambiguous manner such that independent researchers can replicate experiments and escalate the arms race to develop more evolved and robust ML applications. The article provides taxonomies for: 1) the dataset, 2) the ML architecture, 3) the adversary's knowledge, capability, and goal, 4) adversary's strategy, and 5) the defense response. In addition, the relationships among these models and taxonomies are analyzed by proposing an adversarial machine learning cycle. The provided models and taxonomies are merged to form a comprehensive system-driven taxonomy, which represents the arms race between the ML applications and adversaries in recent years. The taxonomies encode best practices in the field and help evaluate and compare the contributions of research works and reveals gaps in the field."

Out of the four different types of HTLVs, HTLV-1 is most prominent in scourging over 20 million people around the world and still not much effort has been made in understanding the epidemiology and controlling the prevalence of this virus. This condition further worsens when most of the infected cases remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime due to the limited diagnostic methods; that are most of the times unavailable for timely detection of infected individuals. Moreover, at present, there is no licensed vaccination for HTLV-1 infection. Therefore, there is a need to develop the faster and efficient diagnostic method for the detection of HTLV-1. Influenced from the outcomes of the machine learning techniques in the field of bio-informatics, this is the first study in which 64 hybrid machine learning techniques have been proposed for the prediction of different type of HTLVs (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3). The hybrid techniques are built by permutation and combination of four classification methods, four feature weighting, and four feature selection techniques. The proposed hybrid models when evaluated on the basis of various model evaluation parameters are found to be capable of efficiently predicting the type of HTLVs. The best hybrid model has been identified by having accuracy, an AUROC value, and F1 score of 99.85 percent, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. This kind of the system can assist the current diagnostic system for the detection of HTLV-1 as after the molecular diagnostics of HTLV by various screening tests like enzyme-linked immunoassay or particle agglutination assays there is always a need of confirmatory tests like western blotting, immuno-fluorescence assay, or radio-immuno-precipitation assay for distinguishing HTLV-1 from HTLV-2. These confirmatory tests are indeed very complex analytical techniques involving various steps. The proposed hybrid techniques can be used to support and verify the results of confirmatory test from the protein mixture. Furthermore, better insights about the virus can be obtained by exploring the physicochemical properties of the protein sequences of HTLVs."

Targeting mTOR for therapeutic interventions in cancer through autophagy pathway is challenging due to the dual roles of autophagy in tumor progression.

In this paper, we have explored two different categories of molecular features – descriptors and fingerprints for developing predictive models using machine learning techniques. Random Forest variable importance measures and autoencoders are used to identify molecular descriptors and fingerprints, respectively. We have built various predictive models using identified features and their combination for predicting mTOR kinase inhibitors. Finally, the best model based on the Mathew correlation co-efficient value over the validation dataset is selected for screening kinase SARfari bioactivity dataset. In this study, we have identified twenty best performing descriptors for predicting mTOR kinase inhibitors.

In addition, the following issues were also investigated: the platforms that stimulated research; identifying LS models utilised in e-learning; the evaluation methods used; and the learning supports provided. The results indicated an increasing interest in using artificial neural network approaches to identify LSs. However, limited work has been conducted on the comparison of deep learning methods in this context. The findings suggest the need to consider and stimulate further empirical investigation in documenting the adoption and comparison of deep learning algorithms in classifying LSs to provide higher adaptability."

The affected hosts and networks sustain significant harm as a result of the infection. Therefore, identifying malware is crucial. Recent attacks, however, is designed to evade detection using Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is essential to create fresh signatures as soon as new malware is found in order to stop this issue. Using a variety of cutting-edge representation methodologies, we develop attack taxonomy and examine it. 1) N-gram-based representation: In this tactic, we look at a number of random representations that consider a technique of sampling the properties of the graph. 2) Signature-based representation: This technique uses the idea of invariant representation of the graph, which is based on spectral graph theory. One of the main causes is that a ML system setup is rely on a number of variables, including the input dataset, ML architecture, attack creation process, and defense strategy. To find any hostile attacks in the network system, we employ IDS with Deep Neural Network (DNN). In conclusion, the efficacy and efficiency of the suggested framework with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are assessed using the assessment indicators, including throughput, latency rate, accuracy and precision. The findings of the suggested model with a detection rate of 93%, 14%, 95.63% and 95% in terms of throughput, latency rate, accuracy and precision, which is based on adversarial assault, were better and more effective than CNN and SVM models. Additionally at the end we contrast the performance of the suggested model with that of earlier research that makes use of the same dataset, NSL-KDD, as we do in our scenario."

  "abstrak": "The inverse Potts problem to infer a Boltzmann distribution for homologous protein sequences from their single-site and pairwise amino acid frequencies recently attracts a great deal of attention in the studies of protein structure and evolution. We study regularization and learning methods and how to tune regularization parameters to correctly infer interactions in Boltzmann machine learning. Using L2 regularization for fields, group L1 for couplings is shown to be very effective for sparse couplings in comparison with L2 and L1 . Two regularization parameters are tuned to yield equal values for both the sample and ensemble averages of evolutionary energy. Both averages smoothly change and converge, but their learning profiles are very different between learning methods. The Adam method is modified to make stepsize proportional to the gradient for sparse couplings and to use a soft-thresholding function for group L1 . It is shown by first inferring interactions from protein sequences and then from Monte Carlo samples that the fields and couplings can be well recovered, but that recovering the pairwise correlations in the resolution of a total energy is harder for the natural proteins than for the protein-like sequences. Selective temperature for folding\/structural constrains in protein evolution is also estimated."

  "judul": "A Machine Learning Based Framework for a Stage-Wise Classification of Date Palm White Scale Disease",
  "abstrak": "Date palm production is critical to oasis agriculture, owing to its economic importance and nutritional advantages. Numerous diseases endanger this precious tree, putting a strain on the economy and environment. White scale Parlatoria blanchardi is a damaging bug that degrades the quality of dates. When an infestation reaches a specific degree, it might result in the tree's death. To counter this threat, precise detection of infected leaves and its infestation degree is important to decide if chemical treatment is necessary. This decision is crucial for farmers who wish to minimize yield losses while preserving production quality. For this purpose, we propose a feature extraction and machine learning (ML) technique based framework for classifying the stages of infestation by white scale disease (WSD) in date palm trees by investigating their leaflets images. 80 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features and 9 hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color moments features are extracted from both grayscale and color images of the used dataset. To classify the WSD into its four classes (healthy, low infestation degree, medium infestation degree, and high infestation degree), two types of ML algorithms were tested; classical machine learning methods, namely, support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and ensemble learning methods such as random forest (RF) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: the first is composed of the extracted GLCM features only, and the second combines GLCM and HSV descriptors. The results indicate that SVM classifier outperformed on combined GLCM and HSV features with an accuracy of 98.29%. The proposed framework could be beneficial to the oasis agricultural community in terms of early detection of date palm white scale disease (DPWSD) and assisting in the adoption of preventive measures to protect both date palm trees and crop yield."

One of these novel devices is the IIoT edge gateway, which is used to connect critical physical systems with the cyber world, and to provide consistent storage, processing, and analytical and controlling capabilities. However, these devices also come with new and advanced threats such as targeted ransomware. In this paper, we investigate this threat in detail. We studied the threat actors' motivations, the anatomy of ransomware for edge gateways, and the likelihood of such ransomware attack to happen in the future. We found that threat actors find IIoT edge gateways attractive ransomware targets due to their vital roles and functionalities in working with critical infrastructure and that the likelihood of such attack to occur is high. We built the first version of a ransomware securitytestbed for IIoT, and for test purposes, we developed a first version of ransomware target at IIoT edge gateway in a brownfield system. From our measurements we conclude that kernel-related activity parameters are significant indicators of the abnormal behavior caused by crypto-ransomware attacks in IIoT edge gateways, much more so even than for similar attacks in information technology server workstation. Thereby, some potential countermeasures for addressing targeted ransomware in IIoT systems are recommended as proactive strategies for dealing with attackers' new techniques and tactics."

Considering that the battery capacity of PIoT devices is limited and difficult to be replaced, we use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist wireless power transmission (WPT) in the SAG-PIoT to ensure the network service quality and safe and stable operation of PIoT. In this paper, we put forward a novel WPT enabled SAG-PIoT architecture, based on which we investigate the dynamic task offloading and resource scheduling, and propose a joint online optimization algorithm for task assignment, local computing resource allocation, association control and UAV computing resource allocation to minimize the long-term time-averaged network operation cost. Since the coupling of task offloading and resource scheduling in the long-term stochastic optimization problem, it is decoupled into three subproblems to be solved separately using Lyapunov optimization. Moreover, we analyze the stability and sustainability of the proposed algorithm and reveal the tradeoff between the network stability and optimal network operation cost. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm has advantageous performances with respect of network stability, energy consumption and network operation cost compared to other benchmark algorithms."

  "abstrak": "In edge-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), computation offloading service is expected to offer users with better Quality of Experience (QoE) than traditional IoT. Unfortunately, the growing multiple tasks from users are occuring with the emergence of the IoT environment. Meanwhile, the current computation offloading with QoE is solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the issue of instability and slow convergence. Therefore, improving the QoE in edge-enabled IoT is still the ultimate challenge. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a new QoE model to study the computation offloading. Specifically, the emerged QoE model can capture three influential elements: 1) service latency determined by local computing latency and transmission latency; 2) energy consumption according to local calculation and transmission consumption; and 3) task success rate based on the coding error probability. Moreover, we improve the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm and propose a algorithm named the double-dueling-deterministic policy gradients (D\n3\nPG) based on the proposed model. Specifically, the actor network highly relies on the critic network, which makes the performance of the DDPG sensitive to the critic and thus leads to poor stability and slow convergence in the computation offloading process. To solve this, we redesign the critic network by using Double Q -learning and Dueling networks. Extensive experiments verify the better stability and faster convergence of our proposed algorithm than existing methods. In addition, experiments also indicate that our proposed algorithm can improve the QoE performance."

In order to providing efficient task offloading and energy-saving policy under an uncertainty aerial environment, a constrained Markov decision process is employed to formulate the task offloading decision problem and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is devised to solve the proposed problem. An adaptive federated DRL-based offloading method is further proposed to find suboptimal offloading decisions by considering the privacy protection and communication failure in the proposed network.

Several types of services can be supplied in the IoT using the user's requirements to consider the user needs. However, the service composition in the IoT does not have any systematic and complete study about examining its significant techniques. So, this paper aims to investigate the available methods in this field using a systematic manner. To achieve a comprehensive view of the topic, all of the selected approaches are divided into four distinct categories, including framework, service oriented architecture and RESTful, heuristic, and model-based. The detailed classifications have been presented using various parameters based on the examination of the existing techniques. Also, the benefits and drawbacks of the state-of-the-art service composition techniques and the important challenges of them are discussed. Finally, we have explained future work in the field of service composition in the IoT with detail in order to make an effective and efficient way for researchers in this area.

Compared with existing studies, the distribution characteristics and correlations between propagation paths in the elevation (e)- and azimuth (a)-angle domains are considered to enhance the estimation performance. Specifically, we first redefine the e-angles and the a-angles to simplify the system model. Then, a novel autoregressive (AR)-Gaussian channel prior is proposed to capture both the sparsity and the clustering properties of mmWave massive MIMO IoT channels. After that, we provide a channel approximation method to overcome the channel uncertainty by exploiting the structure of the AR-Gaussian channel prior. The hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture with limited radio-frequency (RF) chains in mmWave IoT systems is also considered. Finally, we propose a hybrid channel estimation algorithm, which consists of two stages. Based on the different distribution characteristics in different angle domains, the CS-based channel estimation is performed for e-angles on stage one, while the SBL-based channel estimation is applied for a-angles on stage two. Numerical results reveal that compared with the existing CS- and SBL-only methods, the proposed hybrid channel estimation algorithm exhibits better performance in terms of computational complexity, sparsity robustness, and estimation accuracy."

An extension of this vocabulary for the IoT domain (iot.schema.org) is an ongoing research effort to address semantic interoperability for the Web of Things (WoT). To design this vocabulary, a central challenge is to identify the main topics (concepts and properties) automatically from existing knowledge in IoT applications.

This efficiency vastly affects the productivity of the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes when utilized in an industrial environment. The conundrum of using the conventional network architecture in an industry\/factory connected by IoT devices has paved the way for the development of software-defined networking (SDN). Traditional network architectures lack network programmability and hinder the testing and performance evaluation of new communication protocols. The use of vendor-specific hardware is a major hindrance to create a network where the control is centralized for the deployment of different policies over the network. This article aims to find an optimal path for efficient communication between the nodes present in a programmable Industrial IoT (IIoT) network. A programmable IIoT network is created and end-user routing algorithms are designed to find the optimal path for communication. We integrate an SDN framework with IIoT nodes for the creation of a centralized programmable network architecture and deploy custom routing algorithms over it for evaluation. To further reduce the communication latency, we incorporate edge computing servers (ECSs) in the network. Three routing algorithms: 1) K -means-based optimal path algorithm; 2) cluster-based optimal path algorithm; and 3) minimum interval-based optimal path algorithm, that can be deployed over an SDN are proposed in this article.

Since the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to be solved, we decompose it into two joint optimization subproblems.

The second is subcarrier assignment solved by the matching theory.

The target instances’ pseudo labels, which are obtained by calculating the distance between the target instance and the source prototypes, are irrelevant to the classifier and discriminator. Furthermore, the momentum algorithm, by which the historical weights information could be retained, is employed in the source weights calculation procedure to alleviate the fluctuation and more closely to the global optimal.

However, regarding the large number of terminals and constantly dynamics of edge clouds, determining the placement of VNFs and routing service paths that optimizes the end-to-end delays is a challenging problem.

  "abstrak": "In this paper, the problem of network connectivity is studied for an adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker aims at disrupting the connectivity of the network by choosing to compromise one of the IoBT nodes at each time epoch. To counter such attacks, an IoBT defender attempts to reestablish the IoBT connectivity by either deploying new IoBT nodes or by changing the roles of existing nodes. This problem is formulated as a dynamic multistage Stackelberg connectivity game that extends classical connectivity games and that explicitly takes into account the characteristics and requirements of the IoBT network. In particular, the defender's payoff captures the IoBT latency as well as the sum of weights of disconnected nodes at each stage of the game. Due to the dependence of the attacker's and defender's actions at each stage of the game on the network state, the feedback Stackelberg solution [feedback Stackelberg equilibrium (FSE)] is used to solve the IoBT connectivity game. Then, sufficient conditions under which the IoBT system will remain connected, when the FSE solution is used, are determined analytically. Numerical results show that the expected number of disconnected sensors, when the FSE solution is used, decreases up to 46% compared to a baseline scenario in which a Stackelberg game with no feedback is used, and up to 43% compared to a baseline equal probability policy."

  "abstrak": "Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated the prosperity of smart environments such as smart homes. Meanwhile, WiFi is a broadly used technology for the wireless connectivity of IoT devices. However, smart home IoT devices are often vulnerable to various securityattacks. This article quantifies the impact of distributed denial of service (DDoS) and energy-oriented DDoS attacks (E-DDoS) on WiFi smart home devices and explores the underlying reasons from the perspective of attacker, victim device, and access point (AP). Compared to the existing work, which primarily focus on DDoS attacks launched by compromised IoT devices against servers, our work focuses on the connectivity and energy consumption of IoT devices when under attack. Our key findings are threefold. First, the minimum DDoS attack rate causing service disruptions varies significantly among different IoT smart home devices, and buffer overflow within the victim device is validated as critical. Second, the group key updating process of WiFi may facilitate DDoS attacks by causing faster victim disconnections. Third, a higher E-DDoS attack rate sent by the attacker may not necessarily lead to a victim's higher energy consumption. Our study reveals the communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and victim devices' ports state as the vital factors to determine the energy consumption of victim devices. These findings facilitate a thorough understanding of IoT devices' potential vulnerabilities within a smart home environment and pave solid foundations for future studies on defense solutions."

In such a case, accurate traffic identification using port-based and payload-based solutions are not suitable for flow processing in Software-Defined IoT (SD-IoT). In this article, we propose \niAcceSD\n, an intelligent Access Node (SD-Access) and SDN controller (SD-Controller) collaborated traffic identification mechanism for SD-IoT. Concerning the heterogeneous and unknown traffic flows in IoT, iAcceSD uses machine learning (ML)-based traffic identification mechanisms at the access node. The SD-Controller trains a lightweight ML module for a specific SD-Access node dealing with a similar set of traffic flows. By processing flows at the edge, network latency is reduced in the proposed scheme. An optimization model is developed to program the SD-Access nodes considering the heterogeneous and unknown traffic. Thorough performance analysis of iAcceSD shows improvement in latency by 34% and controller overheads by 23.4%, compared to the existing state of the art, with a simultaneous improvement in energy consumption and packet delivery ratio."

The traditional Internet architecture is a host-oriented architecture (i.e., TCP\/Internet protocol (IP) approach) due to which the Internet of Things (IoT) have been facing issues related to datadissemination across the distant locations. Therefore, a quick comprehension to enhance the communication for improving the content transmission services is of upmost importance. To deal with the challenges of traditional IP networks, the ICN paradigm was proposed which is different from traditional IP networking in terms of: 1) naming; 2) routing and forwarding; and 3) caching. One of the most common and important features of ICN architectures is in-network caching, which can significantly reduce content retrieval latency and improve dataavailability. Furthermore, in an ICN-based IoT environment, content caching at intermediate network nodes reduces the path stretch between end users and caches the content to meet future demands. This article compares and thoroughly investigates ICN-based caching strategies in terms of content retrieval latency, cache hit ratio, stretch, and link load, with a focus on IoT-based environments. Following a thorough simulation study, we discovered that ICN in-network caching is one of the most beneficial features for enhancing IoT-based networks."

However, they must compete for bandwidth with traditional applications such as video streaming, video conferencing, and bulk file transfers. Such competition can be detrimental to the IoT applications when home gateways use traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue management. Simply increasing bandwidth between the home gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), even when possible, provides no guarantee of bandwidth for IoT applications since many traditional applications will consume as much bandwidth as is available. In this paper, we explore whether active queue management (AQM), now being implemented in home gateways, can provide protection for IoT flows. We investigate the effect of different AQM algorithms deployed at the home gateway in scenarios with multiple concurrent application flows. We find that deploying multiqueue FlowQueue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) or the hybrid FlowQueue Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (FQ-PIE) at the home gateway can provide excellent capacity sharing, flow isolation, and good protection in terms of throughput and queuing delays for IoT flows and other applications, which cannot be achieved with traditional FIFO or other single-queue AQMs such as Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE)."

In this article, a QoE-aware satellite constellation design scheme is proposed to enhance the user satisfaction by constructing QoE factors. First, an SIoT network model is established with low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the problem is formulated to calculate the QoE for different areas after analyzing the dynamic network topology. Then, the QoE factors are defined to assess QoE by taking into account the coverage performance, communication fluency, regional demand capacity, and profitability. Following that, an intelligent optimization algorithm named multilayer tabu search (MLTS) is designed to obtain reasonable satellite orbits with the best QoE, which provides orbit parameters for satellite constellation configuration. The simulation results demonstrate that the designed satellite constellation can effectively improve the users QoE by optimizing the various QoE factors."

Based on the device-as-a-software concept, we develop an open IoT system architecture which decouples upper-level applications from the underlying physical devices (Physical-D) through the SDD mechanism. A logically centralized controller is designed to conveniently manage Physical-D and flexibly provide the device discovery service and the device control interfaces for various application requests. We also describe an application use scenario which illustrates that the SDD-based system architecture can implement the unified management, sharing, reusing, recombining, and modular customization of device resources in multiple applications, and the ubiquitous IoT applications can be interconnected and intercommunicated on the shared Physical-D."

Multiple IoT gateways are federated through a peer-to-peer overlay implemented by a distributed hash table, which is exploited to share the information on IoT resources available across multiple domains.

The uplink resource allocations for the CIoT are optimized in the decoding-PU-last and decoding-PU-first schemes, respectively, which seek to maximize the average total transmission rate of CIoT while ensuring the minimum transmission rates for PU and each CIoT node. Then, a clustering NOMA-based CIoT is presented to decrease the interuser interference, where the nodes in each cluster use NOMA to transmit in the allocated subchannel. The simulation results have shown the performance advantages for the NOMA-based hybrid spectrum access and better rate guarantee for the clustering NOMA-based CIoT."

Since this issue is an NP-hard obstacle, different metaheuristic approaches have been utilized up until now to solve it. Many varieties of services can be brought into the IoT, depending on users’ demands. In this research, we have proposed an effective way based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) and an ant colony optimization (ACO) to answer the service composition issue by enhancing the QoS. The HMM has been trained to predict QoS. The emission and transition matrices have been improved using the Viterbi algorithm.

A UAV-supported clustered nonorthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) system is put forward in this article.

As the formulated problem suffers nonconvexity and complication, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to address it. First, for fixed UAV trajectory, all the terminals are clustered and a subslot allocation algorithm based on the Lagrange multiplier and bisection method is proposed. Then, for a fixed clustering state and subslot duration, we optimize the UAV trajectory. Finally, we solve these two subproblems alternatively until the objective function converges. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme in the UAV-supported C-NOMA system is verified by the numerical results."

For instance, most IoT applications require timely delivery of collected information, which is a key challenge for the IoT. In this article, novel centralized and distributed resource allocation schemes are proposed to enable IoT devices to share limited communication resources and to transmit IoT messages in a timely manner. In the considered system, the timeliness of information is captured using nonlinear Age-of-Information (AoI) metrics that can naturally quantify the freshness of information. To model the inherent heterogeneity of the IoT system, the nonlinear aging functions are defined in terms of IoT device types and message content. To minimize AoI, the proposed resource management schemes allocate the limited communication resources considering AoI. In particular, the proposed centralized scheme enables the base station to learn the device types and to determine aging functions. Moreover, the proposed distributed scheme enables the devices to share the limited communication resources based on available information on other devices and their AoI. The convergence of the proposed distributed scheme is proved, and the effectiveness in reducing the AoI with partial information is analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed resource management schemes with different number of devices, activation probabilities, and outage probabilities are analyzed in terms of the average instantaneous AoI. Simulation results show that the proposed centralized scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous AoI when compared to simple centralized allocation without learning, while the proposed distributed scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous AoI when compared to random allocation. The results also show that the proposed centralized scheme outperforms the proposed distributed scheme in almost all cases, but the distributed approach is more viable for a massive IoT."

A worst case scenario is assumed, in the sense that, in order to enhance their interception ability all eavesdroppers are located close to each other, near the controller and collude to form joint receive beamforming. For such a system, a novel cooperative nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) secure transmission scheme for which an IoT device with a stronger channel condition acts as an energy harvesting relay in order to assist a second IoT device operating under weaker channel conditions, is proposed and its performance is analyzed and evaluated. A secrecy sum rate (SSR) maximization problem is formulated and solved under three constraints: 1) transmit power; 2) successive interference cancellation; and 3) quality of service. By considering both passive and active eavesdroppers scenarios, two optimization schemes are proposed to improve the overall system SSR. On the one hand, for the passive eavesdropper scenario, an artificial noise-aided secure beamforming scheme is proposed. Since this optimization problem is nonconvex, instead of using traditional but highly complex, brute-force 2-D search, it is conveniently transformed into a convex one by using an epigraph reformulation. On the other hand, for the active multiantennas eavesdroppers’ scenario, the orthogonal-projection-based beamforming scheme is considered, and by employing the successive convex approximation method, a suboptimal solution is proposed. Furthermore, since for single antenna transmission the orthogonal-projection-based scheme may not be applicable a simple power control scheme is proposed. Various performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulations have verified that the proposed schemes outperform other benchmark schemes in terms of SSR performance."

  "abstrak": "Internet of Things (IoT) provides ubiquitous intelligence and pervasive interconnections to diverse physical objects. A key technology to seamlessly integrate different IoT devices into an IoT system is IoT middleware, a software system layer designed to be the intermediary between IoT devices and applications. However, two issues, communication gap and heterogeneous access , prevent the existing IoT middleware from effective application in an IoT system with heterogeneous standards and interfaces. To address this problem, inspired by a graph-based knowledge system for eliminating heterogeneity in business systems, we, in this article, propose a knowledge graph-based multilayer IoT middleware. The proposed multilayer IoT middleware introduces a new layer to bridge the gap between IoT devices with different communication protocols. It is able to uniformly manage all IoT devices by using an IoT knowledge graph. We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach by a real-life IoT project, a remote monitoring project of rural sewage treatment stations located in Yunnan Province, China. We find that the proposed approach effectively resolves the communication gap and heterogeneous access problems that occurred in the system."

With the benefits of SFC, the IoT service providers can steer massive traffic through a sequence of heterogeneous virtual network function instances based on their business logic. SFC is viewed as an attractive solution for building virtualized IoT-dedicated network. However, the SFC orchestration in IoT is still a challenge problem. Existing work usually focuses on the performance guarantee while ignoring the issue of resource idleness. To meet the sharp increase in IoT traffic amounts and the diversification of IoT traffic requirements, it is necessary to implement the performance and resource aware SFC orchestration system. Motivated by this, we propose a novel linear programming model and an effective approximation optimization algorithm for SFC orchestration, in order to achieve performance guarantee while avoiding resource idleness. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, a new prototype system named performance and resource aware orchestration system of SFC for IoT (PRSFC-IoT) is built upon OpenStack for online SFC orchestration. A large number of simulation experiments show that the PRSFC-IoT outperforms existing solutions for SFC orchestration in IoT."

  "abstrak": "There is unanimous consensus that cyber security in the Internet of Things (IoT) is necessary. In cyber security, key establishment is one of the toughest problems. It is even more challenging in resource-constrained but Internet-connected IoT devices that use low-power wireless communication. A number of IoT communication protocols define cryptographic mechanisms for confidentiality and integrity services but do not specify key management. For example, IEEE 802.15.4, RPL, and object security all rely on external key management protocols. Due to the lack of automatic key management support, IoT devices either end up using preshared keys or no security at all. In this paper, we overcome these challenges and present TinyIKE, a lightweight adaptation of Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) for the IoT. Using TinyIKE, we solve the key establishment problem for multiple IoT protocols using a single IKEv2-based solution. We implement TinyIKE for resource-constrained IoT devices that run the Contiki OS. The TinyIKE implementation supports full certificate-based IKEv2 that uses elliptic curve cryptography. In order to ensure the feasibility of TinyIKE in the IoT, we perform an extensive evaluation of TinyIKE using a setup consisting of real IoT hardware."

In order to providing efficient task offloading and energy-saving policy under an uncertainty aerial environment, a constrained Markov decision process is employed to formulate the task offloading decision problem and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is devised to solve the proposed problem. An adaptive federated DRL-based offloading method is further proposed to find suboptimal offloading decisions by considering the privacy protection and communication failure in the proposed network.

Since the coupling of task offloading and resource scheduling in the long-term stochastic optimization problem, it is decoupled into three subproblems to be solved separately using Lyapunov optimization.

Nevertheless, the existing double auction mechanisms mostly focus on the design of truthfulness and ignore the importance of privacy preservation. Hence, in this article, we propose PP-SPEC, a truthful and privacy-preserving double auction mechanism that takes spatial reuse, spectrum heterogeneity, and multiminded bidders into account, and provides full privacy in terms of asking prices, bidding values, and locations. To tackle the challenge of privacy-preserving comparison over ciphertext field, we carefully designed a set of generic privacy-preserving ciphertext comparison protocols (PIC), including basic PIC (B-PIC) and extended PIC (E-PIC), by integrating additive homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits. Furthermore, we have theoretically proved the truthfulness and security of PP-SPEC.

Compared with existing studies, the distribution characteristics and correlations between propagation paths in the elevation (e)- and azimuth (a)-angle domains are considered to enhance the estimation performance. Specifically, we first redefine the e-angles and the a-angles to simplify the system model. Then, a novel autoregressive (AR)-Gaussian channel prior is proposed to capture both the sparsity and the clustering properties of mmWave massive MIMO IoT channels. After that, we provide a channel approximation method to overcome the channel uncertainty by exploiting the structure of the AR-Gaussian channel prior. The hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture with limited radio-frequency (RF) chains in mmWave IoT systems is also considered. Finally, we propose a hybrid channel estimation algorithm, which consists of two stages. Based on the different distribution characteristics in different angle domains, the CS-based channel estimation is performed for e-angles on stage one, while the SBL-based channel estimation is applied for a-angles on stage two. Numerical results reveal that compared with the existing CS- and SBL-only methods, the proposed hybrid channel estimation algorithm exhibits better performance in terms of computational complexity, sparsity robustness, and estimation accuracy."

Although the Internet of Terrestrial Things (IoTT) has been at the center of our IoT perception, it has been recently extended to different environments, such as the Internet of Underwater Things (IoWT), the Internet of Biomedical Things (IoBT), and Internet of Underground Things (IoGT). Even though radio frequency (RF) based wireless networks are regarded as the default means of connectivity, they are not always the best option due to the limited spectrum, interference limitations caused by the ever-increasing number of devices, and severe propagation loss in transmission mediums other than air. As a remedy, optical wireless communication (OWC) technologies can complement, replace, or co-exist with audio and radio wave-based wireless systems to improve overall network performance. To this aim, this paper reveals the full potential of OWC-based IoT networks by providing a top-down survey of four main IoT domains: IoTT, IoWT, IoBT, and IoGT. Each domain is covered by a dedicated and self-contained section that starts with a comparative analysis, explains how OWC can be hybridized with existing wireless technologies, points out potential OWC applications fitting best the related IoT domain, and discusses open communication and networking research problems.

However, it is usually challenging to provide reliable and efficient random access control when massive IoT devices are trying to access the network simultaneously. In this article, we investigate methods to introduce intelligent random access management for a massive cellular IoT network to reduce access latency and access failures. Toward this end, we introduce two novel frameworks, namely, local device selection (LDS) and intelligent preamble selection (IPS). LDS enables local communication between neighboring devices to provide cluster-wide cooperative congestion control, which leads to a better distribution of the access intensity under bursty traffics. Taking advantage of the capability of reinforcement learning in developing cooperative multiagent policies, IPS is introduced to enable the optimization of the preamble selection policy in each IoT clusters. To handle the exponentially growing action space in IPS, we design a novel reinforcement learning structure, named branching actor–critic, to ensure that the output size of the underlying neural networks only grows linearly with the number of action dimensions. Simulation results indicate that the introduced mechanism achieves much lower access delays with fewer access failures in various realistic scenarios of interests."

Nevertheless, due to lack of mobility support in the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs), which is standardized for multihop IoT infrastructures, providing reliable communications in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR) in mobile IoT applications has become significantly challenging. While several studies tried to enhance the adaptability of RPL to network dynamics, their utilized routing metrics have prevented them from establishing long-lasting reliable paths. Furthermore, the stochastic parent replacement policy in the standard version of RPL has intensified this challenge. Aside from this, due to the existing tradeoff between reliability and power efficiency, most of the existing approaches have only concentrated on one of these concerns without paying attention to the other one. To address these issues, this article introduces ARMOR, a routing mechanism built upon RPL, which employs a novel mobility-aware routing metric, i.e., time to reside (TTR), and a corresponding parent replacement policy. According to the motion characteristics of the mobile objects, TTR provides an estimation of how long the nodes will be in the transmission range of each other. This enables ARMOR to select nodes, which provide longer connection period and consequently higher reliability. In comparison with the state of the art, while keeping the power consumption constant, ARMOR significantly improves the amount of PDR in the network by up to 2.5× , while it enhances the reliability against the original version of this protocol by up to 4.2× ."

To satisfy stringent requirements on the latency of IoT communications, the IoT devices communicate in the finite blocklength regime, wherein the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) has a backoff factor and decoding error probability is nonnegligible. Aiming to jointly optimize the sum SE and the maximum error probability, we first express the achievable SE as a function of the channel coefficients, precoders, and error probabilities. Subsequently, we formulate a problem with respect to precoders and error probabilities. A straightforward approach for the formulated problem, however, is challenging as it not only has multiple objectives but also is nonconvex. To resolve these issues, we first transform the problem as a single-objective optimization by using a weighted sum approach. Based on the reformulation, we propose an algorithm, in which error probabilities and precoders are determined by alternating two phases. Via simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method offers significant gains compared to baseline methods, in terms of the achievable SE and the maximum error probability. In particular, we show that the communication latency is greatly reduced by using the proposed method."

The well-known Kronecker model is applied to characterize stochastic channel state information (CSI) errors. For each case, we aim to minimize the (average) total mean square error (MSE) of all datastreams subject to the practical per-antenna power constraints. To address the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient majorization–minimization (MM)-based iterative algorithm to transform the original problem into a series of convex subproblems with semiclosed-form optimal solutions. For low-complexity implementation, we also develop an alternative scheme for directly finding a high-quality suboptimal solution by considering both worst case hardware impairments and worst case CSI errors. In particular, since an explicit expression of the average total MSE for the perfect CSIR and imperfect CSIT case is hard to derive, we instead optimize its effective upper and lower bounds. The prospective applications of our work in the two currently popular multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) IoT scenarios are then discussed. Furthermore, we fundamentally reveal the MSE floor effect caused by both hardware distortion and CSI imperfection in the high-SNR regime. Numerical results illustrate the excellent average total MSE and average bit error rate (BER) performance of our proposed algorithms over the adopted benchmark schemes."

To reduce the overhead of channel state information acquisition and the complexity of transceiver design, an integrated framework of massive beam-division multiple access (BDMA) is proposed according to the characteristics of beamspace propagation. Then, we analyze the performance of the proposed massive BDMA scheme and derive a closed-form expression for the weighted sum rate in terms of channel conditions and system parameters. To improve the overall performance, we propose a massive access algorithm by jointly optimizing transmit power and receive vector. It is found that the optimal receive vector for each IoT device is the base beam corresponding to the arrival of angle of the IoT device's signal in the beamspace, which significantly simplifies the design of the receiver. Considering the constraint of radio-frequency (RF) chains in practical networks, we propose a clustering-based massive access algorithm, which allocates an RF chain for a cluster. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms can provide small overhead and low complexity massive access schemes for B5G cellular IoT."

  "abstrak": "With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing has emerged to help traditional cloud computing in meeting scalability demands. Fog computing makes it possible to fulfill real-time requirements of applications by bringing more processing, storage, and control power geographically closer to end devices. However, since fog computing is a relatively new field, there is no standard platform for research and development in a realistic environment, and this dramatically inhibits innovation and development of fog-based applications. In response to these challenges, we propose the Fog Development Kit (FDK). By providing high-level interfaces for allocating computing and networking resources, the FDK abstracts the complexities of fog computing from developers and enables the rapid development of fog systems. In addition to supporting application development on a physical deployment, the FDK supports the use of emulation tools (e.g., GNS3 and Mininet) to create realistic environments, allowing fog application prototypes to be built with zero additional costs and enabling seamless portability to a physical infrastructure. Using a physical testbed and various kinds of applications running on it, we verify the operation and study the performance of the FDK. Specifically, we demonstrate that resource allocations are appropriately enforced and guaranteed, even amidst extreme network congestion. We also present simulation-based scalability analysis of the FDK versus the number of switches, the number of end devices, and the number of fog devices."

  "judul": "A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimizing the Age-of-Computing-Enabled IoT",
  "abstrak": "Age of Information (AoI) is a newly rising metric for measuring the freshness of information. In this article, we consider a multidevice computing-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) system with a common destination, in which the status update sampled by the device can be offloaded directly to the destination for computing or computed by the device and then delivered to the destination, and jointly design offloading and scheduling policies to minimize the average weighted sum of AoI and energy consumption. The challenge lies in computing mode selection and its strong coupling with scheduling decisions. To address this issue, we formulate the optimization problem as a bilevel discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) and approximate the optimal solution by relative value iteration. Furthermore, the threshold structure of the MDP policy is shown. However, with the expansion of the system scale, the MDP policy will suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In light of this, we develop a learning-based algorithm based on emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to reduce the dimensionality of state space and utilize a late experience storage method to train two heterogeneous artificial neural networks (ANNs) synchronously during the training process. Simulation results show the structure of the MDP policy and verify the performance of the DRL policy is near-optimal."

Moreover, in the majority of the solutions, integrating new devices is a time-consuming task performed manually that cannot be accomplished in a scenario with thousands, maybe millions of devices. In this sense, this article proposes a new IoT middleware, called In.IoT, a scalable, secure, and innovative middleware solution that addresses the middleware concerns identified in this article. In.IoT architectural recommendations and requirements are detailed and can be replicated by new and available solutions. It supports MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP as application-layer protocols. Its performance is evaluated in comparison with the most promising solutions available in the literature and the results obtained by the proposed solution are extremely promising. In.IoT is evaluated, demonstrated, validated, and it is ready and available for use."

Such devices, commonly called Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with sensing\/actuation capabilities, are becoming capable of managing the complexity of communications over the Internet. Nevertheless, the IoT ecosystem is still fragmented due to the different used vertical solutions. This heterogeneity makes IoT devices\/systems unable to communicate seamlessly, leading to limited cooperation and tightly coupled deployments. To deal with the interoperability issues in IoT, we propose, in this paper, a Cloud-based approach with a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) mechanism enabling the IoT devices to communicate using the Representational state transfer (REST) model: an approach that follows the Web of things (WoT) paradigm. In particular, the system makes the IoT devices’ hosted resources (e.g., sensors and actuators) able to be steered using globally resolvable (over the Internet) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) even when deployed behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls. The system we conceived requires only one public registered domain name to associate, for all the distributed IoT devices, sub-domains of the public one while using a clever routing mechanism. An online implementation of the testbed is provided to show the feasibility of the approach. Further, a performance evaluation of the system is reported to assess the resource usage of the solution."

With limited resources of IoT devices, mobile computation offloading can be exploited to offload part of the applications to nearby devices that have more powerful computing resources, thereby speeding up the applications and reducing the energy consumption. In this paper, we consider application partitioning and collaborative computation offloading in IoT networks, in order to meet the completion deadline of the applications while minimizing the overall energy consumption. The problem is formulated as a binary integer linear programming problem, which is transformed into a weighted bipartite matching problem and then solved by the centralized Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. To fit the large-scale IoT scenarios, three distributed algorithms are then introduced from different perspectives. The first one is referred to as the noncooperative matching (NCM) algorithm, where each node makes offloading decision based on its own interest in minimizing energy consumption. Afterward, an asynchronous greedy matching (AGM) algorithm is developed by considering the mutual interest of the requestor and collaborator pairs in terms of their energy consumptions. Finally, a maximum differential energy matching (MDEM) algorithm is devised by relaxing the network stability requirement, which can further benefit the energy efficiency for all network nodes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that both the NCM and AGM algorithms guarantee the network stability and improve the energy saving compared with entirely local execution, while the MDEM algorithm can further achieve near-optimal energy consumption at the expense of higher implementation overheads."

Designing resource allocation schemes to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence a key IoT challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource allocation solutions that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive scale and stringent resource constraints. In this paper, a novel finite memory multistate sequential learning framework is proposed to enable diverse IoT devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both delay-tolerant, periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed learning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical messages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed learning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of memory and computational capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning framework is proved, and the lowest expected delay that the IoT devices can achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different delay targets, network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes is analyzed in terms of the probability of a successful random access (RA) request and percentage of devices that learned correctly. Simulation results show that, for a delay threshold of 1.25 ms, the average achieved delay is 0.71 ms and the delay threshold is satisfied with probability 0.87.

These challenges invoke the use of model-driven development (MDD) along with the representational state transfer (REST) architecture to develop IoT applications, supporting model generation at different abstraction levels while generating software implementation artifacts for heterogeneous platforms and ensuring loose coupling in complex IoT systems. This article proposes an IoT application development framework, named IADev, which uses attribute-driven design and MDD to address the above-mentioned challenges. This framework is composed of two major steps, including iterative architecture development using attribute-driven design and generating models to guide the transformation using MDD. IADev uses attribute-driven design to transform the requirements into a solution architecture by considering the concerns of all involved stakeholders, and then, MDD metamodels are generated to hierarchically transform the design components into the software artifacts. We evaluate IADev for a smart vehicle scenario in an intelligent transportation system to generate an executable implementation code for a real-world system. The case study experiments proclaim that IADev achieves higher satisfaction of the participants for the IoT application development and service orchestration, as compared to conventional approaches. Finally, we propose an architecture that uses IADev with the Siemens IoT cloud platform for service orchestration in industrial IoT."

There are extensive overlapping coverage areas among the BSs in which some heavy computational tasks from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be divided and offloaded to multiple BSs via the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique for parallel processing. However, it is a challenging issue about how to make proper task offloading decisions among multiple connected BSs while satisfying delay requirements of multiple devices. To address this challenge, this article presents an efficient multidevice and multi-BSs task offloading scheme with the goal of minimizing the delay for completing the tasks of the devices. By conducting quantitative analysis of local delay and offloading delay, a nonlinear and nonconvex delay optimization offloading problem, which is based on the theory of noncooperative game, is formulated. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium by analyzing the feature of the proposed offloading problem and further propose a distributed task offloading algorithm called DOLA. Finally, simulation experiments based on real-world dataset from the Melbourne CBD area of Australia are conducted to validate the efficacy of our DOLA algorithm.

  "abstrak": "The past decades have witnessed an explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) services requiring intensive computation resources. The conventional IoT devices, however, are usually equipped with very limited computation resources, which results in degraded quality of experience when executing the resource-hungry applications. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables smart terminals (STs) to offload parts of their computation workloads to the edge servers located at cellular base stations (BSs), has provided a promising approach to address this issue. In this article, we investigate the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled multiaccess MEC. Specifically, by exploiting the advanced NOMA, an ST can simultaneously offload its computation workloads to different edge servers (ESs), which thus reduces the overall delay in completing the ST's computation workloads. To study this problem, we formulate a joint optimization of the computation resource allocations at the ESs, the ST's offloaded workloads and its radio resource allocations for NOMA transmission, with the objective of minimizing a system wise cost that accounts for the overall delay in finishing the ST's total computation workload and the total computation resource usage cost at the ESs. Despite the nonconvexity of the joint optimization problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose an efficient layered algorithm to find the optimal solution. By exploiting the optimal offloading solution of a single ST, we further investigate the scenario of multiple STs and propose two algorithms to determine the optimal grouping among different ESs for serving the STs, with one algorithm aiming at minimizing the total cost of all STs and the other algorithm aiming at determining the Nash stable grouping for the ESs. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and show the performance gain of our proposed NOMA-enabled multiaccess computation offloading."

The current IoT platforms lack techniques for transparent and tamper-proof ordering of events due to their device-centric logging mechanism. In this article, we develop a framework that facilitates tamper-proof transparency and event order in an IoT platform by proposing a Blockchain protocol and adopting the vector clock system, both tailored for the resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, respectively. To cope with the unsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof-of-work puzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT devices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular arithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Blockchain designed for resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT platforms. Our event ordering protocol based on the vector clock system is also novel for the IoT platforms. We implement our framework using an IoT gateway and 30 IoT devices. We experiment with ten concurrent trigger-action-based event chains while each chain involves 20 devices, and each device participates in five different chains. The results show that our framework may order these events in 2.5 s while consuming approximately 140 mJ of energy per device. The results, hence, demonstrate the proposed platform as a practical choice for many IoT applications, such as smart home, traffic monitoring, and crime investigation."

Specifically, each individual builds a sparse cognitive network of nodes to respond to. Based on this simplified cognitive network representation, each user then determines his security management policy by minimizing his own real-world security cost. The bounded rational decision-makings of players and their cognitive network formations are interdependent and thus should be addressed in a holistic manner. We establish a games-in-games framework and propose a Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution concept to characterize the decisions of agents and quantify their risk of bounded perception due to the limited attention. In addition, we design a proximal-based iterative algorithm to compute the GNE. With case studies of smart communities, the designed algorithm can successfully identify the critical users whose decisions need to be taken into account by the other users during the security management."

  "abstrak": "The explosive rise of Internet of Things (IoT) systems have notably increased the potential attack surfaces for cybercriminals. Accounting for the features and constraints of IoT devices, traditional security countermeasures can be inefficient in dynamic IoT environments. In this vein, the advantages introduced by software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have the potential to reshape the landscape of cybersecurity for IoT systems. To this aim, we provide a comprehensive analysis of security features introduced by NFV and SDN, describing the manifold strategies able to monitor, protect, and react to IoT security threats. We also present lessons learned in the adoption of SDN\/NFV-based protection approaches in IoT environments, comparing them with conventional security countermeasures. Finally, we deeply discuss the open challenges related to emerging SDN- and NFV-based security mechanisms, aiming to provide promising directives to conduct future research in this fervent area."

  "abstrak": "Smart city services are enabled by a massive use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The huge amount of sensors, and terminals with a great variety of typologies and applications, requires a secure way to manage them. Capillary networks can be seen as a short range extension of conventional access network in order to efficiently capture the IoT traffic, and are enablers for smart city services. They can include both IP and non-IP devices, and security can become an issue, especially when simple unidirectional communication devices are considered. The main goal of this paper is to analyze security aspects in IoT capillary networks including unidirectional and bidirectional IP or non-IP devices. We propose an algorithm for secure access for uni- and bi-directional devices. The security procedure is based on a secure key renewal (without any exchange in air), considering a local clock time and a time interval of key validity. Following previous work in 2014 by Giuliano et al., in this paper we assess the duration of the validity of the time window, and present extended simulation results in terms of (average) transmission time in a realistic scenario, i.e., including the presence of disturber(s), then providing indications for the setting of the duration of the key validity time window. Finally, we present the benchmark analysis in order to assess the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other existing standards, as well as the security analysis in terms of typical attacks."

  "abstrak": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices comes with many challenges among which security is one of the most serious issues. In order to address the security issue for low-end IoT devices, ARM recently proposed the platform security architecture (PSA), which provides execution isolation to safely manage and protect the computing resources of low-end IoT devices. However, developers implementing IoT services for PSA-based IoT devices need to follow complex development procedures and understand the PSA hardware, which dramatically increases the development time and cost of PSA-based IoT devices. This article analyzes vulnerabilities that may arise from general-purpose low-end IoT devices to derive the security requirements and essential security services for PSA-based IoT devices, and proposes a secure platform model based on the analysis results. The proposed secure platform model consists of System Security Services and Application Security Services based on the basic PSA model and essential trusted subsystems, and it is designed to be flexible and applicable to various types of PSA-based IoT devices. In addition, it provides secure platform services APIs to enable easy and fast development of IoT services. To evaluate the proposed secure platform model, two proof-of-concept implementations are provided by using both the basic PSA model with secure element (SE) and a reference device for ARM’s PSA. Finally, a case study shows that the development of IoT services can be done easily and quickly using the proposed security platform model."

In this paper, we study secure downlink transmission from a controller to an actuator, with the help of a cooperative jammer to fight against multiple passive and noncolluding eavesdroppers. In addition to artificial noise aided secrecy beamforming for secure transmission, cooperative jamming (CJ) is explored to further enhance physical layer security. In particular, we provide a secrecy enhancing transmit design to minimize the secrecy outage probability (SOP), subject to a minimum requirement on the secrecy rate. Based on a strict mathematical analysis, we further characterize the impacts of the main channel quality and the minimum secrecy rate on transmit designs. Numerical results confirm that our design can enhance both security (in terms of SOP) and power efficiency as compared with the approach without CJ."

With ever-increasing penetration of IoT, it becomes of great importance to ensure the IoT security, as the security threats are extended from the cyber world to the physical world. In this article, we investigate physical-layer authentication to help verify the identity of IoT entities for preventing unauthorized access to information or service. Specifically, we propose a Gaussian-tag-embedded physical-layer authentication (GTEA) scheme by using a weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT). Through the superimposition of a low-power Gaussian WFRFT tag onto the message signal, the legitimate receiver can verify the authenticity of the received signal at the physical layer, without being detected by adversaries. Moreover, security analysis shows that with the deliberately designed Gaussian tag, the GTEA scheme is robust against spoofing and replaying attacks. In addition, tradeoff analysis and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the capability of the GTEA scheme in achieving reliability of the message delivery, stealth of the embedded tag signal, and balancing the tradeoff among the robustness of user authentication. Moreover, a prototype is further developed using FPGA and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance improvement of the proposed GTEA scheme."

The positive benefits of IIoT are increasing the demand for devices, but without proper security design foundations, CIs may be open to many different attack vectors. This lack of IIoT device security standards is a major concern. Due to the nature of these infrastructures and impact of compromises, CI device security is an utmost concern and must be focused on during all phases of development and manufacturing as opposed to the addition of security after functional design as seen with many current Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Many of these sensors and devices have limited resources, such as low power consumption, reduced memory storage, and reduced fixed-point processing capabilities. Traditional security protocols and solutions are often not practical on these restrained devices, and there are no current standards for characterizing device security. This paper presents a candidate security level-based architecture for low power IoT-CI devices implementing modular, low power, security primitives that are shown through simulation models and embedded software implementation to create a robustly layered defense-in-depth IoT architecture. This candidate architecture will help provide a foundation for future CI-IoT device security standardization."

  "abstrak": "Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is expected to be the de facto messaging IoT standard. Therefore, MQTT must achieve efficient security. Nevertheless, the most significant drawback of the MQTT is its lack of protection mechanisms. Meanwhile, the existing approaches have added processing overhead to the devices and are still vulnerable to various attacks. Therefore, this research work presented an integrated scheme known as the Robust Security Scheme (RSS) to protect the MQTT against any exploitations that might result in sophisticated cyberattacks. The proposed RSS employs two cryptosystems: 1) a dynamic variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (D-AES); and 2) Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). RSS introduces a new design architecture of the symmetric AES algorithm to encrypt the MQTT payload called D-AES. Additionally, the second part of the proposed hybrid cryptosystem is KP-ABE, which is utilized to cipher the private key of the proposed D-AES to avoid the computation overhead of bilinear maps. The performance of the proposed RSS is measured in terms of processing time and traffic overhead. Additionally, the security aspects are evaluated in terms of balance, avalanche effect, and hamming distance and compared to the existing works in a testbed environment. Results revealed that the proposed D-AES is more promising with improvements than the standard AES algorithm. The proposed scheme achieves polymorphism while maintaining interoperability. RSS exhibited improvements over the standard AES algorithm by 8.75%, 10.45%, and 6.81% in terms of balance, avalanche effect, and hamming distance, respectively."

Considering the different delay requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) users, we propose a two-slot hybrid cooperative NOMA security (THCNS) scheme that utilizes the cooperative interference between NOMA user pairs to enhance the security of offloading. In the first time slot, the interference to the eavesdropper comes from the task signals (TSs) transmitted by the two users, while in the second time slot comes from jamming signal (JS) transmitted by the user who has completed the offloading tasks. The weighted sum secrecy outage probability (wSOP) and secrecy computation probability (SCP) are utilized to measure the security performance of users in the proposed scheme. To confirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed scheme, we analyze the impact of some key parameters on users' security, including the users' local computation time and offloading time, transmit power, task allocation coefficients of two time slots. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is more suitable for the case where the wiretap channel outperforms the main channel, and it can enhance the system security when selecting the optimal parameters. Finally, the numerical simulation results reveal how the analysis parameters affect the security performance of users and validate the theoretical analysis, it provides good insights about how to design parameters of IoT users to enhance their security performance in MEC system."

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT.

Space–air–ground-integrated network (SAGIN) is widely believed to be an ideal infrastructure for connecting IoV.

TrustZone-M, a TrustZone extension designed specifically for MCUs, is an emerging hardware security technique fortifying software security of MCU-based IoT devices. This article introduces a comprehensive security framework for IoT devices using TrustZone-M-enabled MCUs, in which device security is protected in five dimensions, i.e., hardware, boot-time software, runtime software, network, and over-the-air (OTA) update. Along developing the framework, we also present the first security analysis of potential runtime software security issues in TrustZone-M-enabled MCUs. In particular, we explore the feasibility of launching stack-based buffer overflow (BOF) attack for code injection, return-oriented programming (ROP) attack, heap-based BOF attack, format string attack, and attacks against nonsecure callable (NSC) functions in the context of TrustZone-M. We validate these attacks using SAM L11, a microchip MCU with TrustZone-M and provide defense mechanisms in the runtime software dimension of the proposed framework.

To explore this gap, this paper presents a review of existing security standards and assessment frameworks which also includes several NIST special publications on security techniques highlighting their primary areas of focus to uncover those that can potentially address some of the security needs of IoT-based smart environments. Cumulatively a total of 80 ISO\/IEC security standards, 32 ETSI standards and 37 different conventional security assessment frameworks which included 7 NIST special publications on security techniques were reviewed.

  "abstrak": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaped by the increasing number of low-cost Internet-connected embedded devices that are becoming ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life. With their cost-sensitive design, integrating hardware-based security mechanisms into such devices is undesirable. Therefore, securing these devices is a particularly difficult challenge, especially, due to their growing popularity as attack targets, via remote malware infestations. The vast majority of such devices are bare-metal, where they execute programs in fully-accessible and unprotected memories without any operating system and even without including any form of security. This is beside the fact that IoToperating systems offer little or no protection. This paper addresses this problem through the concept of a Security MicroVisor (S μ V), which provides embedded devices that lack hardware-based memory protection units with memory isolation using software virtualisation and assembly-level code verification. More specifically, our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose S μ V as a software-based memory isolation technique. We then formally verify the software architecture, written in C, to prove that it is memory-safe and crash-free. Second, we propose a software-based remote attestation, as an example of a fundamental security service that can be implemented on top of S μ V, to detect malware-infected devices. We first describe the design and implementation of S μ V. Then, we highlight the formal verification of software architecture, and characterize the remote attestation protocol. We evaluate the S μ V implementation using an 8-bit AVR microcontroller that is widely used in IoT devices. Evaluation results show that S μ V provides strong security guarantees while maintaining extremely low overhead in terms of memory footprint, performance, and power consumption. Furthermore, we extend the performance evaluation also to the remote attestation scheme, illustrating its limited overhead."

To this end, techniques in which the security of IoT devices is decoupled from the applications they run can provide significant benefits and enable the development of new standardization strategies. This article presents a study of the benefits provided by IoTsafe, a security decoupling approach when used in combination with the constrained application protocol (CoAP). Whereas previous work relied on HTTP\/HTTP2 protocols, the present article is focused on the analysis of the feasibility of IoTsafe in more constrained devices in channels with high interference levels. The benefits of this technique are illustrated by means of a battery of tests to evaluate the impact of this scheme. The results show no performance penalty (taking CoAP with security as a baseline) in lossless channels, even when an overhead increment of 38% is borne. Furthermore, in lossier channels, a transfer time reduction of 36% is achieved, a figure that increases significantly if traffic compression is enabled."

Such (nano-scale) devices can be used in various healthcare settings such as continuous health monitoring, targeted drug delivery, and nano-surgeries. These services can also be grouped to form a collaborative network (i.e., nanonetwork), whose performance can potentially be improved when connected to higher bandwidth external networks such as the Internet, say via 5G. However, to realize the IoBNT paradigm, it is also important to seamlessly connect the biological environment with the technological landscape by having a dynamic interface design to convert biochemical signals from the human body into an equivalent electromagnetic signal (and vice versa).

This increasing popularity has also placed smart devices as the center of attention among attackers. Already, several types of malicious activities exist that attempt to compromise the security and privacy of smart devices. One interesting and noteworthy emerging threat vector is the attacks that abuse the use of sensors on smart devices. Smart devices are vulnerable to sensor-based threats and attacks due to the lack of proper security mechanisms available to control the use of sensors by installed apps. By exploiting the sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, light sensor, etc.) on a smart device, attackers can extract information from the device, transfer malware to a device, or trigger a malicious activity to compromise the device.

  "judul": "3-D Stochastic Geometry-Based Modeling and Performance Analysis of Efficient Security Enhancement Scheme for IoT Systems",
  "abstrak": "Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming core building blocks for different services and applications supporting every day’s life. The heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and the complex use scenarios make it hard to build secure and private IoT systems. Physical-layer security (PLS) can lead to efficient solutions reducing the impact of the increasing security threats. In this work, we propose a new PLS-based IoT transmission scheme that offers a highly secured transmission probability, low-computational complexity, and reduced power consumption. We utilize 3-D stochastic geometry to model a more realistic IoT system and test our proposed scheme in different practical scenarios, where sensors, access points (APs), and eavesdroppers are randomly located in 3-D space. We focus on the system performance, in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secured successful transmission probability (SSTP), using tight closed-form expressions. An optimization problem is developed to deduce the optimal sensors’ transmit power, the APs’ density, and the maximum number of transmission tentative, when maximizing the SSTP. The proposed scheme outperforms the baseline retransmission scheme, in terms of SOP and SSTP based on analytical and simulation results."

  "abstrak": "The rapid development and wide application of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies have produced good opportunities for the development of IoT-based smart home systems (SHSs). However, during the rapid market expansion of SHSs, security challenges associated with SHSs have become a primary concern of people because they are so closely related to people’s daily lives. These security problems may damage information assets and pose a serious threat to people’s health and life. This study investigates security issues in SHSs and provides a comprehensive overview of research to date. In this review, after analyzing the existing definition and concept of SHSs proposed by authoritative encyclopedias and academic literature, we propose a more accurate, elaborated definition of SHSs, analyze their architecture, extract six natural and contextual features, and summarize spears (cyber-attack means) vs. shields (countermeasures) in detail in the context of SHSs. Then, the security frameworks and evaluation technologies in SHSs are discussed. Different scenarios for technology integration and the practical research results in SHSs, such as blockchain, cloud computing, Internet of Vehicles, and AI are presented meticulously. After that, two special issues related to security are discussed. We believe that future research on SHS security should focus on four aspects: the unification of architecture, resource limitation, fragmentation, and code and firmware security. In addition, research on SHS security should be given priority over its commercialization process."

Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog\/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT."

  "judul": "AI-Based Joint Optimization of QoS and Security for 6G Energy Harvesting Internet of Things",
  "abstrak": "The data privacy and confidentiality in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks have been one of the most concerned problems due to increasing threats. The commonly utilized IoT chips adopt a fixed authentication and encryption scheme in the link layer even though multiple options are usually supported. As different authentication and encryption operations mean dissimilar protections and various energy consumption, the fixed security strategy neglects the remaining energy, dynamic threats, and diverse service requirements, leading to low energy efficiency. Moreover, fixed high-level security protections consume too much energy even though the security requirement may be low, which results in a short working time. To address this problem, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based adaptive security specification method for 6G IoT networks where the IoT devices are connected to cellular networks via different frequency bands, including terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave). The IoT sensing devices are assumed to support the energy harvesting technique which is expected to be widely adopted in 6G. In our proposal, the extended Kalman filtering (EKF) method is first adopted to predict future harvesting power. Then, in each energy-aware cycle, we design a mathematical model to calculate the required energy of different security strategies and choose the supported highest level protection which can meet service requirement and avoid energy exhaustion. The simulation results illustrate that the proposal can not only provide satisfied security protection for different services but also adjust the security protection to avoid the energy exhaustion, leading to a significant improvement of throughput and working time."

This increases the need for an automated and secure onboarding procedure for IoT devices, systems and services. Device manufacturers are entering the market with internet connected devices, ranging from small sensors to production devices, which are subject of security threats specific to IoT. The onboarding procedure is required to introduce a new device in a System of Systems (SoS) without compromising the already onboarded devices and the underlying infrastructure. Onboarding is the process of providing access to the network and registering the components for the first time in an IoT\/SoS framework, thus creating a chain of trust from the hardware device to its hosted software systems and their provided services. The large number and diversity of device hardware, software systems and running services raises the challenge to establish a generic onboarding procedure. In this paper, we present an automated and secure onboarding procedure for SoS. We have implemented the onboarding procedure in the Eclipse Arrowhead framework. However, it can be easily adapted for other IoT\/SoS frameworks that are based on Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) principles. The automated onboarding procedure ensures a secure and trusted communication between the new IoT devices and the Eclipse Arrowhead framework. We show its application in a smart charging use case and perform a security assessment."

The lightweight and low-power physical layer security (PLS) technology is employed to protect the information from eavesdropping. Taking the imperfect channel state information (CSI) into account, we formulate a problem to optimize the beamforming vector, artificial noise (AN), transmit power, and subcarrier assignment policy aiming to maximize the worst case sum secrecy rate under the Quality of Service (QoS) and power consumption constraints. Since the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to be solved, we decompose it into two joint optimization subproblems. The first is resource allocation with given subcarrier assignment, which is solved by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. The second is subcarrier assignment solved by the matching theory. Our simulation shows that the proposed scheme is robust against the CSI imperfectness of the eavesdropping and self-interference channels, while providing significant sum secrecy rate improvement compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA), half duplex (HD) systems, and other benchmark schemes."

IoT technology finds applications in a broad spectrum of areas such as homes, health, water and sanitation, transportation, and environmental monitoring. However, the endless opportunities and benefits of IoT come with many security challenges due to the reduced computation, communication, storage, and energy capabilities of the IoT smart devices. Several computationally lightweight cryptographic protocols exist for these resource-constrained IoT smart devices. However, lightweight solutions render the resource-rich ends of the IoT systems (e.g., edge, fog, or cloud modes) vulnerable as nodes at those ends have the capacity for computationally heavier cryptographic protocols, and they operate in relatively more malicious environments. This asymmetric computational nature of IoT systems requires security protocols that can adapt to the resource availability at the node that they operate. This survey describes the IoT structure, computational capabilities of the devices at the end, edge, fog, and cloud platforms, and classifies existing lightweight cryptographic protocols. The comparative analysis of the existing lightweight cryptographic solutions along with their advantages, drawbacks, and vulnerabilities highlights the need for elastic cryptographic protocols which are capable of adapting to the asymmetric capabilities of the different nodes in IoT systems."

In this article, taking IoT devices as the network resources competed between an attacker and a defender, we study the modeling and analysis of network resource competition in an attack-defense game. The attacker and defender inject different competition strength in each IoT device as their strategies. As a result, the security state of each IoT device will change, which is captured by differential equations. To study the interaction between the attacker and defender and the evolution of the system security states, a zero-sum differential game is formulated by modeling the competition of IoT devices. To achieve the equilibrium of the formulated differential game, optimal control theory is employed to solve the optimization problems of players. Further, a Gauss–Seidel-like implicit finite-difference method is utilized to obtain the saddle point strategy. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the evolution of network resource competition between the attacker and defender. The results show that our formulated model can effectively and accurately characterize the evolution of the system security states with strategic interactions between the attacker and defender."

To enhance the information security, we aim to maximize the secrecy sum rate (SSR) for PUs by jointly designing the beamforming matrix and vectors at the central controller. To efficiently solve the nonconvex problem, we first propose the branch-reduce-and-bound (BRB)-based algorithm to obtain an upper bound for the SSR and offer a feasible solution by Gaussian randomization, which demands two-level iteration and thus has high complexity. To strike a balance between the complexity and the performance, we then propose iterative algorithm based on constrained-convex-concave programming (CCCP) and a zero forcing (ZF)-based noniterative algorithm, the latter of which with lowest complexity is suitable for the central controller with limited-power supply. The simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimization algorithms in comparison to the traditional schemes."

There is ample ongoing research and efforts to produce devices that are secure-by-design. However, these efforts are still far from translation into actual deployments. To address this, worldwide efforts towards IoT device and software certification have accelerated as a potential solution, including UK’s IoT assurance program, EU Cybersecurity Act and the US executive order 14028. In EU, the Cybersecurity Act was launched in 2019 which initiated the European cybersecurity certification framework for Internet and Communications Technology (ICT). The heterogeneity of the IoT landscape with devices ranging from industrial to consumer, makes it challenging to incorporate IoT devices in the certification framework or introduce a European cybersecurity certification scheme solely for IoT. This paper analyses the cybersecurity certification prospects for IoT devices and also places article 54 of the EU Cybersecurity Act in an international perspective. We conducted a comparative study of existing IoT certification schemes to identify potential gaps and extract requirements of a candidate IoT device security certification scheme. We also propose an approach that can be used as a template to instantiate an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for IoT devices. In the proposed template, we identify IoT-critical elements from the article 54 of the Cybersecurity Act. We also evaluate the proposed template using the ENISA qualification system for cybersecurity certification schemes and show its qualification on all criteria."

  "abstrak": "Advances in emerging Information and Communications Technology (ICT) technologies push the boundaries of what is possible and open up new markets for innovative ICT products and services. The adoption of ICT products and systems with security properties depends on consumers’ confidence and markets’ trust in the security functionalities and whether the assurance measures applied to these products meet the inherent security requirements. Such confidence and trust are primarily gained through the rigorous development of security requirements, validation criteria, evaluation, and certification. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (often referred to as Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO\/IEC 15408) for cyber security. Motivated by encouraging the adoption of the CC that is used for ICT security evaluation and certification, in this paper, we conduct a systematic review of the CC standard and its adoptions. Adoption barriers of the CC are investigated based on the analysis of current trends in cyber security evaluation. In addition, we share the experiences and lessons gained through the recent Development of Australian Cyber Criteria Assessment (DACCA) project on the development of the Protection Profile that defines security requirements with the CC. Best practices, challenges, and future directions on defining security requirements for trusted cyber security advancement are presented."

  "abstrak": "Research and processing development on satellite communications has strongly re-emerged in recent years. Following the prosperity of various wireless services provided by satellite communications, the security issue has raised growing concerns since the space information network is susceptible to be eavesdropped by illegal adversaries in such a large-scale wireless network. Recently, the physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as an alternative security paradigm that explores the randomness of the wireless channel to achieve confidentiality and authentication. The success story of the PLS technique now spans a decade and thrives to provide a layer of defense in satellite communications. With this position, a comprehensive survey of satellite communications is conducted in this article with an emphasis on PLS. We first briefly introduce essential background and the view of the satellite Internet of Things (IoT), as well as discuss related research challenges faced by the emerging integrated network architecture. Then, we revisit the most popular satellite channel model influenced by many factors and list the commonly used secrecy performance metrics. Also, we provide an exhaustive review of state-of-the-art research activity on PLS in satellite communications, which we categorize by different architectures including land mobile satellite communication networks, hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay networks, and satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. In addition, a number of open research problems are identified as possible future research directions."

There is a complete “meridian-collateral diagram” in Internet of things and any finite system, so that any “sickness” of the system can be cured effectively. On the other hand, this paper studies the network attack and defense from the perspective of the information theory. Through mathematical modeling, based on the famous Shannon's coding theorem, the research on the ability problem of attacker and defender is transformed into the research on the channels of attacker and defender. From the perspective of the channel capacity in information theory for the first time, this paper gives the reachable theoretical limitation of the attack ability of hacker and the defend ability of honker precisely."

The privacy-preserving issue of IoT query, which is a typical service, has attracted much attention. A superior candidate for solving the above issue is classical cryptographic schemes based on the computational difficulty. With the advent of quantum computation, the security of such schemes may be broken by the strong ability of some advanced quantum algorithms. How to design a secure scheme for privacy-preserving query under the threat of quantum computation is crucial. To this end, we construct a general architecture of privacy-preserving query in IoT scenarios. Besides trust or honesty-but-curious models, we present a scheme for privacy-preserving query which is also valid in the scenario of untrusted devices. We provide a detailed security analysis. The result shows our scheme achieves private preservation of both service providers and clients."

  "abstrak": "Recently, the security of Internet of Things (IoT) has been an issue of great concern. Physical layer security methods can help IoT networks achieve information-theoretical secrecy. Nevertheless, utilizing physical security methods, such as artificial noise (AN) may cost extra power, which leads to low secure energy efficiency. In this paper, the hybrid precoding technique is employed to improve the secure energy efficiency of the IoT network. A secure energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated for the IoT network. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem and the feasible domain, the problem is first transformed into a tractable suboptimal form. Then, a secure hybrid precoding energy efficient (SEEHP) algorithm is proposed to tackle the problem. The numerical results indicate that the proposed SEEHP algorithm achieves higher secure energy efficiency compared with three existing physical layer security algorithms, especially when the number of transmit antennas is large."

  "abstrak": "This paper investigates the physical-layer security of uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in the cellular Internet of Things (IoT) with invoking stochastic geometry. Poisson cluster process-based model is applied to characterize the NOMA uplink transmission scenario, where IoT terminals are located around the serving base station. Considering the severe interference brought by a large number of IoT terminals, inter-cell interference is also taken into account. To enhance the physical-layer security of uplink NOMA transmission with limited overhead increment at IoT terminals, the base stations not only receive the signals from IoT terminals but also keep emitting jamming signals all the time to degrade the performance of any potential eavesdroppers. In order to characterize the physical-layer security performances, we derive expressions of coverage probability and secrecy outage probability. To obtain further insights, network-wide secrecy throughput (NST) and network-wide secrecy energy efficiency (NSEE) are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the security performance can be improved by the proposed full-duplex base station jamming scheme at the cost of reliable performance. The analytical and simulation results show the effects of BS intensity and jamming power on network performances. We also verify that NST and NSEE can be significantly enhanced by our proposed scheme. Using these results, the security of confidential information transmitted by low-complexity IoT terminals can be protected from overhearing."

These devices provided convenience to healthcare provider since they can continuously monitor their patients in real-time, while allowing them to have greater physical flexibility and mobility. However, users of healthcare services (such as patients and medical staff) often are less concerned about security issues associated with IoT. These alleviate existing problems and jeopardize the lives of their patients by making them susceptible to attacks. Furthermore, IoMT applications have direct access to healthcare services because it handles sensitive patient information. Therefore, it is extremely important to preserve and establish the security and privacy of IoMT. This further justifies the need to investigate and address the related issues. Despite existing literature on security and privacy mechanisms, the domain still requires more attention. Therefore, this paper aims to discuss the security and privacy principles, as well as challenges associated with IoMT. Besides, a comprehensive analysis of privacy and security solutions for IoMT is also presented.

It is highly required to safeguard a good atmosphere free from security and privacy threats to get the desired performance from IoD applications. Security and privacy issues have significantly restricted the overall influence of the IoD paradigm.

Smart grids, which are cost-effective and environmentally friendly applications, are a promising field of the SIoT. However, security and privacy concerns are the dark aspects of smart grids. The goal of this paper is to address the security and privacy issues in the vehicle-togrid (V2G) networks with the intention of promoting a more extensive deployment of V2G networks for smart grids. Driven by this motivation, in this paper, we propose a robust key agreement protocol that can achieve mutual authentication without exposing the real identities of users. Efficiency is also a major concern in resource-constrained environments. By leveraging only hash functions and bitwise exclusive-OR operations, the proposed protocol is highly efficient compared with pairing-based protocols. In addition, we define a formal security model for our privacy-preserving key agreement protocol for V2G networks. Using this model, a formal security analysis shows that the proposed protocol is secure. Moreover, an informal security analysis demonstrates that our protocol can withstand different types of attacks."

Moreover, commercialization of IoT has led to public security concerns, including personal privacy issues, threat of cyber attacks, and organized crime. In order to provide a guideline for those who want to investigate IoT security and contribute to its improvement, this survey attempts to provide a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and countermeasures against them on the edge-side layer of IoT, which consists of three levels: (i) edge nodes, (ii) communication, and (iii) edge computing.

Second, we discuss the possible applications of IoT and potential motivations of the attackers who target this new paradigm. Third, we discuss different attacks and threats. Fourth, we describe possible countermeasures against these attacks. Finally, we introduce two emerging security challenges not yet explained in detail in previous literature."

Thus, information security has become a major concern in the communication environment of IIoT and AI, where security and privacy must be ensured for the messages between a sender and the intended recipient. In this article, we propose a method called Harris hawks optimization-integer wavelet transform (HHO-IWT) for covert communication and secure data in the IIoT environment based on digital image steganography. The method embeds secret data in the cover images using a metaheuristic optimization algorithm called HHO to efficiently select image pixels that can be used to hide bits of secret data within integer wavelet transforms. The HHO-based pixel selection operation uses an objective function evaluation depending on the following two phases: exploitation and exploration. The objective function is employed to determine an optimal encoding vector to transform secret data into an encoded form generated by the HHO algorithm. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method with respect to visual quality, payload capacity, and security against attacks. The obtained results reveal that the HHO-IWT method achieves higher levels of security than the state-of-the-art methods and that it resists various forms of steganalysis. Thus, utilizing this approach can keep unauthorized individuals away from the transmitted information and solve some security challenges in the IIoT."

We then evaluate the security of the designed protocol, including the widely used automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA), and demonstrate that it supports mutual authentication between IoT nodes and server, and is resilient against a number of common security attacks [denial of service (DoS), replay, spoofing, etc.].

Users may refrain from using such systems if they realize that security measures are not in place. In this context, one of the most important IoT components has not received the necessary attention by the community: the gateway. IoT gateways play a central role in an IoT system as they solve heterogeneity issues. However, if compromised, gateways can be a source of security threats, and these threats become more relevant due to the gateway's central role. Gateways connect IoT devices and cloud services, and successful attacks on this component may exploit this fact. Using a well-known security requirements (SRs) engineering approach, this article evaluates and prioritizes SRs specifically for IoT gateways. The prioritization highlights a set of SRs that must be observed when evaluating and improving the gateway security level. Also, current solutions are detailed to support the enforcement of such SRs. Finally, a set of open challenges are discussed to highlight current research gaps that must be addressed to support SRs."

IoT devices remain at higher risk of attack due to their intrinsic properties which include but are not limited to extreme heterogeneity, mostly plug-and-play nature, computational limitations, improper patch management, unnecessary open ports, default or no security credentials, and extensive use of reusable open-source software. To address these security concerns we need to thoroughly understand IoT devices’ vulnerabilities, associated attacks, and how criminal services can abuse these devices. In this article, we present recent advances in IoT security vulnerabilities, criminal services by empirically identifying major vulnerable IoT devices and cyber attacks exploiting them by cyber criminals.

The ongoing diversity and the sheer increase in the number of connected IoT devices have crumpled security efforts. There is a need to reconsider and redesign the underlying concept of developing security systems to resolve IoT security challenges. In this backdrop, device profiling and identification have emerged as an exciting technique that helps to reduce IoT device attack surface. One of the known approaches for device identification is to fingerprint a device. There are many ways to fingerprint the device, mostly using device network flows or device local attributes. The device identification ensures the authenticity of the device attached to the network, like user authentication. Since IoT devices mostly work using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, this requires identifying each device properly. But there is no unified approach for device identification for the ever-growing world of IoT devices and applications. One of the major steps forward in this direction is the development of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard that defines the role of a device within the network. It limits the device to execute the primary task only, which will help to reduce the attack surface. Since the inception of MUD, many security frameworks use this standard for IoT security. However, there is a need to scrutinize the security frameworks based on the MUD, to find out the claimed effectiveness of the standard in IoT security. This paper initially identifies and classifies the potential vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Then, the study provides an overview of the research that focuses on device identification techniques and analyzes their role in IoT security. Finally, the research presents an overview of MUD technology, its implementation scenarios, the limitation of the latest MUD standard, and its applications in the industry. The prime aim of this work is to examine the MUD benefits in IoT security along with the weaknesses and challenges while implementing this standard along with future directions."

Hundreds of authentication schemes tailored for IoT environments have been proposed in recent years, and regrettably, many of them were soon found to have succumbed to security vulnerabilities. In an effort to investigate the underlying reason for this, Wang et al. (at TIFS’23) recently analyzed the vulnerability of authentication schemes from the perspective of provable security. However, we observe that some authentication schemes with sound security proofs and heuristic security analysis are also not resistant to certain attacks, and even those that have been improved several times are still not immune. To explore the deep-seated reasons for security vulnerabilities in IoT authentication schemes, we divide security attacks into explicit and implicit attacks and find that many authentication schemes exhibit security under explicit attacks but are rendered vulnerable under implicit attacks. Further, we propose the relationship between the design goals of security attributes of authentication schemes and implicit attacks, analyze the vulnerability of three typical authentication schemes under implicit attacks, and find that only the security attributes capable of resisting the strongest implicit attacks are secure. Finally, we offer some specific suggestions on how to achieve the security attribute goals."

The widespread of intelligent IoT devices has greatly expanded the attack surface for cyber-attacks. Additionally, the cloud-based centralized management architecture of traditional IIoT is susceptible to single-point-of-failure, which exacerbates the security risks. Nowadays, the secure and decentralized nature of blockchain has been considered a promising solution to address the security and privacy challenges in IIoT. This article proposes a blockchain-based operational architecture for IIoT (SecureArchi- IIoT) to enhance security and privacy in IIoT operations. Under this architecture, a set of smart contracts are designed to provide operational functionalities that are suitable for actual industrial demands. An operational control policy is designed to realize precise and effective management of the operation permissions with distinct granularity. Furthermore, a reputation-based behavioral punishment mechanism is developed to enhance the security performance of the proposed architecture. The prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented in a private IIoT environment to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. Experimental results confirm that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional architecture in aspects of security and privacy and maintains acceptable real-time performance."

  "judul": "Securing the Internet of Things: A Standardization Perspective",
  "abstrak": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next wave of innovation that promises to improve and optimize our daily life based on intelligent sensors and smart objects working together. Through Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, devices can now be connected to the Internet, thus allowing them to be read, controlled, and managed at any time and at any place. Security is an important aspect for IoT deployments. However, proprietary security solutions do not help in formulating a coherent security vision to enable IoT devices to securely communicate with each other in an interoperable manner. This paper gives an overview of the efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to standardize security solutions for the IoT ecosystem. We first provide an in-depth review of the communication security solutions for IoT, specifically the standard security protocols to be used in conjunction with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an application protocol specifically tailored to the needs of adapting to the constraints of IoT devices. Since Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) has been chosen as the channel security underneath CoAP, this paper also discusses the latest standardization efforts to adapt and enhance the DTLS for IoT applications. This includes the use of 1) raw public key in DTLS; 2) extending DTLS record Layer to protect group (multicast) communication; and 3) profiling DTLS for reducing the size and complexity of implementations on embedded devices. We also provide an extensive review of compression schemes that are being proposed in IETF to mitigate message fragmentation issues in DTLS."

  "judul": "A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues in Internet-of-Things",
  "abstrak": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) are everywhere in our daily life. They are used in our homes, in hospitals, deployed outside to control and report the changes in environment, prevent fires, and many more beneficial functionality. However, all those benefits can come of huge risks of privacy loss and security issues. To secure the IoT devices, many research works have been conducted to countermeasure those problems and find a better way to eliminate those risks, or at least minimize their effects on the user's privacy and security requirements. The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks. The next segment will focus on the mechanisms and architectures for authentication and access control. The last segment will analyze the security issues in different layers."

  "judul": "Consumer, Commercial, and Industrial IoT (In)Security: Attack Taxonomy and Case Studies",
  "abstrak": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming ubiquitous in our lives, with applications spanning from the \nconsumer\n domain to \ncommercial\n and \nindustrial\n systems. The steep growth and vast adoption of IoT devices reinforce the importance of sound and robust cybersecurity practices during the device development life cycles. IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited can affect, not only the device itself but also the application field in which the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability are an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this article, we provide an attack taxonomy, which takes into consideration the different layers of the IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer’s designated characteristics, which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies. These (and many other) incidents highlight the underlying security concerns of IoT systems and demonstrate the potential attack impacts of such connected ecosystems, while the proposed taxonomy provides a systematic procedure to categorize attacks based on the affected layer and corresponding impact."

  "judul": "Analysis on Security and Privacy Guidelines: RFID-Based IoT Applications",
  "abstrak": "The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises many technologies, among them is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which can be used to track single or multiple objects. This technology has been widely used in healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and asset tracking. However, such applications require a high level of security and privacy and are unfortunately vulnerable to various attacks and threats that need to be addressed in order for RFID-based IoT applications to reach their full potential. To this end, we propose a set of security and privacy guidelines for RFID, supported by modelling guidelines, mitigations, and the attack vectors cohesively. We compare to the state of the art and point out their shortcomings on known guidelines and reason to address these in our model. The overall methodology is as follows: (i) identify the security and privacy guideline features, (ii) highlight the security goals for RFID-based IoT applications, (iii) analyze the features in relation to RFID industrial standards, and relate them to security goals, (iv) summarize attacks and threats against RFID applications and correlate them with violated security goals, (v) derive a set of security and privacy guidelines for RFID applications in accordance with security and privacy by design frameworks. We also describe our derived guidelines in connection with the involved stakeholders, and (vi) outline the existing mitigation strategies to implement our proposed guidelines. Finally, we describe the main limitations of our work that should be investigated in the future and identify the multiple challenges that concern current security strategies."

  "judul": "Arm PSA-Certified IoT Chip Security: A Case Study",
  "abstrak": "With the large scale adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in people's lives and industrial manufacturing processes, IoT security has become an important problem today. IoT security significantly relies on the security of the underlying hardware chip, which often contains critical information, such as encryption key. To understand existing IoT chip security, this study analyzes the security of an IoT security chip that has obtained an Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Level 2 certification. Our analysis shows that the chip leaks part of the encryption key and presents a considerable security risk. Specifically, we use commodity equipment to collect electromagnetic traces of the chip. Using a statistical T-test, we find that the target chip has physical leakage during the AES encryption process. We further use correlation analysis to locate the detailed encryption interval in the collected electromagnetic trace for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption operation. On the basis of the intermediate value correlation analysis, we recover half of the 16-byte AES encryption key. We repeat the process for three different tests; in all the tests, we obtain the same result, and we recover around 8 bytes of the 16-byte AES encryption key. Therefore, experimental results indicate that despite the Arm PSA Level 2 certification, the target security chip still suffers from physical leakage. Upper layer application developers should impose strong security mechanisms in addition to those of the chip itself to ensure IoT application security."

  "judul": "On the Security–Reliability and Secrecy Throughput of Random Mobile User in Internet of Things",
  "abstrak": "Physical-layer security (PLS) in Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted great attentions recently. Although mobility is an intrinsic property of IoT networks, most of the existing works only investigate the secure transmission design for static users. To fill this gap, this article specifically investigates the secrecy throughput maximization problems for the mobile IoT user under two typical mobility models: 1) random waypoint model (RWP) and 2) random direction model (RD). The insights about how the mobility patterns, and security–reliability requirements affect the mobile user’s secrecy throughput are revealed. First, in order to establish the relationship between security and reliability of the mobile user, a general analytic framework is provided to derive the closed-form expressions of transmit secrecy outage probability (TSOP) for the mobile user. Second, two transmission schemes are proposed to maximize the secrecy throughput of the mobile user by ensuring a certain level of transmit probability (TP) and TSOP requirements. The numerical and simulation results verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed schemes, and indicate that by adopting appropriate mobility pattern, the user’s secrecy throughput can be improved, and the constraint on its moving region can be largely reduced. Those properties are lightweight and feasible to enhance security for many mobile IoT scenarios."

  "judul": "The Global State of Security in Industrial Control Systems: An Empirical Analysis of Vulnerabilities Around the World",
  "abstrak": "Operational Technology (OT) networks and devices, i.e., all components used in industrial environments, were not designed with security in mind. Efficiency and ease of use were the most important design characteristics. However, due to the digitization of industry, an increasing number of devices and industrial networks are opened up to public networks. This is beneficial for the administration and organization of the industrial environments. However, it also increases the attack surface, providing possible points of entry for an attacker. Originally, breaking into production networks meant to break an information technology (IT)-perimeter first, such as a public Website, and then to move laterally to industrial control systems (ICSs) to influence the production environment. However, many OT-devices are connected directly to the Internet, which drastically increases the threat of compromise, especially since OT-devices contain several vulnerabilities. In this work, the presence of OT-devices in the Internet is analyzed from an attacker’s perspective. Publicly available tools, such as the search engine \nShodan\n and vulnerability databases, are employed to find commonly used OT-devices and map vulnerabilities to them. These findings are grouped according to the country of origin, manufacturer, and number as well as severity of vulnerability. More than 13000 devices were found, almost all contained at least one vulnerability. European and Northern American countries are by far the most affected ones."

  "judul": "Physical Layer Enhanced Zero-Trust Security for Wireless Industrial Internet of Things",
  "abstrak": "As security issues facing the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) continue to emerge, industrial organizations are working to further improve the security system. Zero trust (ZT) is seen as the future of industrial security, with a rising voice, but currently, no concrete implementation technique is available. In this article, we start with the requirements of ZT security and attempt to design a ZT technical framework applicable to wireless IIoT. Specifically, a three-step ZT security framework is proposed that builds on the benefits of physical-layer security to enhance ZT in IIoT. Security zone formation is done first, which then facilitates a trusted environment for subsequent device authentication and cryptographic negotiation. By integrating physical-layer security, several promising techniques, including artificial noise, physical fingerprint, and key distribution, are well designed to accomplish the proposed framework. Our analysis reveals that the proposed framework and the designed particular implementation techniques are feasible to enhance ZT security in wireless IIoT."

  "judul": "ALAM: Anonymous Lightweight Authentication Mechanism for SDN-Enabled Smart Homes",
  "abstrak": "The smart connected devices are the first choice of cybercriminals for spreading spy wares and different security attacks. The current security standards and protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) have failed in providing security to these devices. In addition, IoT market giants are producing nonsecure smart products in order to grab the open market. Furthermore, low resources of IoT devices, limits the traditional host-based protection solutions like anti-virus, IDS, IPS, etc. To overcome the resource constraintness and security barriers of smart devices, a network-level security architecture based on lightweight cryptographic parameters is required. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm to overcome the control, management, and security issues in traditional networking. The SDN controller handles all the computation and complexities at the network level, rather than smart devices. In this research, we first present a new privacy-preserving security architecture for SDN-based smart homes. Subsequently, an anonymous lightweight authentication mechanism (ALAM) is designed based on the proposed security architecture core foundations. Furthermore, the security characteristics of the proposed protocol are formally analyzed using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic and ProVerif, followed by informal security analysis. Finally, performance evaluation and comparative analysis of the scheme is carried out."
